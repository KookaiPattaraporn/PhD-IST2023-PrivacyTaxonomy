abstract = {A fundamental problem in many disciplines is the classification of objects in a domain of interest into a taxonomy. Developing a taxonomy, however, is a complex process that has not been adequately addressed in the information systems (IS) literature. The purpose of this paper is to present a method for taxonomy development that can be used in IS. First, this paper demonstrates through a comprehensive literature survey that taxonomy development in IS has largely been ad hoc. Then the paper defines the problem of taxonomy development. Next, the paper presents a method for taxonomy development that is based on taxonomy development literature in other disciplines and shows that the method has certain desirable qualities. Finally, the paper demonstrates the efficacy of the method by developing a taxonomy in a domain in IS. {\textcopyright} 2013 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {[Context] In legal requirements elicitation, requirements analysts need to extract obligations from legal texts. However, legal texts often express obligations only indirectly, for example, by attributing a right to the counterpart. This phenomenon has already been described in the Requirements Engineering (RE) literature [1]. [Objectives] We investigate the use of requirements templates for the systematic elicitation of legal requirements. Our work is motivated by two observations: (1) The existing literature does not provide a harmonized view on the requirements templates that are useful for legal RE; (2) Despite the promising recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP), automated support for legal RE through the suggestion of requirements templates has not been achieved yet. Our objective is to take steps toward addressing these limitations. [Methods] We review and reconcile the legal requirement templates proposed in RE. Subsequently, we conduct a qualitative study to define NLP rules for template recommendation. [Results and Conclusions] Our contributions consist of (a) a harmonized list of requirements templates pertinent to legal RE, and (b) rules for the automatic recommendation of such templates. We evaluate our rules through a case study on 400 statements from two legal domains. The results indicate a recall and precision of 82,3{\%} and 79,8{\%}, respectively. We show that introducing some limited interaction with the analyst considerably improves accuracy. Specifically, our human-feedback strategy increases recall by 12{\%} and precision by 10,8{\%}, thus yielding an overall recall of 94,3{\%} and overall precision of 90,6{\%}.},

abstract = {The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) aims to protect personal data of EU residents and can impose severe sanctions for non-compliance. Organizations are currently implementing various measures to ensure their software systems fulfill GDPR obligations such as identifying a legal basis for data processing or enforcing data anonymization. However, as regulations are formulated vaguely, it is difficult for practitioners to extract and operationalize legal requirements from the GDPR. This paper aims to help organizations understand the data protection obligations imposed by the GDPR and identify measures to ensure compliance. To achieve this goal, we propose GuideMe, a 6-step systematic approach that supports elicitation of solution requirements that link GDPR data protection obligations with the privacy controls that fulfill these obligations and that should be implemented in an organization's software system. We illustrate and evaluate our approach using an example of a university information system. Our results demonstrate that the solution requirements elicited using our approach are aligned with the recommendations of privacy experts and are expressed correctly.},

As a result, organizations must take a systematic approach to ensure that their business processes comply with these regulations. In the past, we introduced a requirements framework that mapped regulations documents and goals to goal and scenario models of organizational processes. The intent was to help organizations document and manage the compliance of their processes in the face of evolutionary changes. In this paper, we extend our framework by incorporating regulation scenario models and by adding the notion of contribution link level to the compliance link types. These extensions result in a framework that is more aligned to the needs of an organization when it must evaluate and ensure the legal compliance of its organizational processes. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {[Context and motivation] Communication in distributed software development is usually supported by issue tracking systems. Within these systems, most of the communication is stored as unstructured natural language text. The natural language text, however, contains much information with respect to requirements management, e.g. discussion, clarification and prioritization of features, bugs, and refactorings. [Question] This paper investigates the information stored in the issue tracking systems of four different open-source projects. It categorizes the text and reports on the distribution of issue types and information types. [Principal ideas/results] A manual analysis of 80 issues, using a grounded approach, is conducted to derive a taxonomy of issue types and information types. Subsequently, the taxonomy is used as a codebook, to manually categorize and structure the text in another 120 issues. [Contribution] The first contribution of this paper is the taxonomy of issue and information types and the second contribution is an in-depth analysis of the natural language data and the communication. This analysis showed, for example, that information with respect to prioritization and scheduling can be found in natural language data, whether the ITS supports such tasks in a structured way or not.},

abstract = {Privacy by design (PbD) is a policy measure that guides software developers to apply inherent solutions to achieve better privacy protection. For PbD to be a viable option, it is important to understand developers' perceptions, interpretation and practices as to informational privacy (or data protection). To this end, we conducted in-depth interviews with 27 developers from different domains, who practice software design. Grounded analysis of the data revealed an interplay between several different forces affecting the way in which developers handle privacy concerns. Borrowing the schema of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), we classified and analyzed the cognitive, organizational and behavioral factors that play a role in developers' privacy decision making. Our findings indicate that developers use the vocabulary of data security to approach privacy challenges, and that this vocabulary limits their perceptions of privacy mainly to third-party threats coming from outside of the organization; that organizational privacy climate is a powerful means for organizations to guide developers toward particular practices of privacy; and that software architectural patterns frame privacy solutions that are used throughout the development process, possibly explaining developers' preference of policy-based solutions to architectural solutions. Further, we show, through the use of the SCT schema for framing the findings of this study, how a theoretical model of the factors that influence developers' privacy practices can be conceptualized and used as a guide for future research toward effective implementation of PbD.},

A privacy goal that has not yet been deeply studied is the empowerment of end-users to have control over how their personal data is processed by information systems. This privacy goal is called intervenability. Several surveys have shown that one of end-users' main privacy concerns is the lack of intervenability options in information systems. In this paper, we refine the privacy goal intervenability into a software requirements taxonomy and relate it to a taxonomy of transparency requirements because transparency can be regarded as a prerequisite for intervenability. The combined taxonomy of intervenability and transparency requirements shall guide requirements engineers to identify the intervenability requirements relevant for the system they consider. We validated the completeness of our taxonomy by comparing it to the relevant literature that we derived based on a systematic literature review.},

abstract = {Data privacy when using online systems like Facebook and Amazon has become an increasingly popular topic in the last few years. However, only a little is known about how users and developers perceive privacy and which concrete measures would mitigate their privacy concerns. To investigate privacy requirements, we conducted an online survey with closed and open questions and collected 408 valid responses. Our results show that users often reduce privacy to security, with data sharing and data breaches being their biggest concerns. Users are more concerned about the content of their documents and their personal data such as location than about their interaction data. Unlike users, developers clearly prefer technical measures like data anonymization and think that privacy laws and policies are less effective. We also observed interesting differences between people from different geographies. For example, people from Europe are more concerned about data breaches than people from North America. People from Asia/Pacific and Europe believe that content and metadata are more critical for privacy than people from North America. Our results contribute to developing a user-driven privacy framework that is based on empirical evidence in addition to the legal, technical, and commercial perspectives.},

However, the significance of privacy policies greatly exceeds the attention paid to them: these documents are binding legal agreements between website operators and their users, and their opaqueness is a challenge not only to Internet users but also to policy regulators. One proposed alternative to the status quo is to automate or semi-automate the extraction of salient details from privacy policy text, using a combination of crowdsourcing, natural language processing, and machine learning. However, there has been a relative dearth of dataseis appropriate for identifying data practices in privacy policies. To remedy this problem, we introduce a corpus of 115 privacy policies (267K words) with manual annotations for 23K fine-grained data practices. We describe the process of using skilled annotators and a purpose-built annotation tool to produce the data. We provide findings based on a census of the annotations and show results toward automating the annotation procedure. Finally, we describe challenges and opportunities for the research community to use this corpus to advance research in both privacy and language technologies.},

This work examines the challenge of developing tool support for extracting such requirements from legal documents. To address this challenge, we have developed a tool called GaiusT. The tool is founded on a framework for textual semantic annotation. It semiautomatically generates elements of requirements models, including actors, rights, and obligations. We present the complexities of annotating prescriptive text, the architecture of GaiusT, and the process by which annotation is accomplished. We also present experimental results from two case studies to illustrate the application of the tool and its effectiveness relative to manual efforts. The first case study is based on the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, while the second analyzes the Italian accessibility law for information technology instruments.},

abstract = {With the introduction of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), concerns about compliance started to arise among software companies inside and outside Europe. In order to achieve high compliance, software developers must consider those privacy and data protection goals defined across the different legal provisions in the GDPR. Prior work has introduced methods to systematically extract taxonomies of privacy requirements out of the GDPR's legal provisions. That is, a hierarchy of meta-requirements that can be instantiated for each specific software project. Particularly, ProPAn is a requirements elicitation method which leverages such taxonomies with the aim of achieving high levels of compliance. However, despite of its benefits, the method presents a high documentation overhead and redundancy across the artifacts it generates. In this work, we introduce a lightweight method named PDP-ReqLite initially inspired from ProPAn that introduces new artifacts for the documentation of personal data and information flows in a system-to-be. The purpose of PDP-ReqLite is to improve usability and applicability by reducing documentation overhead and complexity, and by introducing means to automate tasks, e.g., automated requirements elicitation. In particular, this improved method provides additional features for incorporating new meta-requirements thus enlarging existing taxonomies.},

abstract = {Increasingly, companies use multi-source data to operate new information systems, such as social networking, e-commerce, and location-based services. These systems leverage complex, multi-stakeholder data supply chains in which each stakeholder (e.g., users, developers, companies, and government) must manage privacy and security requirements that cover their practices. US regulator and European regulator expect companies to ensure consistency between their privacy policies and their data practices, including restrictions on what data may be collected, how it may be used, to whom it may be transferred, and for what purposes. To help developers check consistency, we identified a strict subset of commonly found privacy requirements and we developed a methodology to map these requirements from natural language text to a formal language in description logic, called Eddy. Using this language, developers can detect conflicting privacy requirements within a policy and enable the tracing of data flows within these policies. We derived our methodology from an exploratory case study of the Facebook platform policy and an extended case study using privacy policies from Zynga and AOL Advertising. In this paper, we report results from multiple analysts in a literal replication study, which includes a refined methodology and set of heuristics that we used to extract privacy requirements from policy texts. In addition to providing the method, we report results from performing automated conflict detection within the Facebook, Zynga, and AOL privacy specifications, and results from a computer simulation that demonstrates the scalability of our formal language toolset to specifications of reasonable size. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract = {Context Practitioners and researchers often claim that agile methods have moved into the mainstream for the last few years. To support this claim they refer to recent industrial surveys which tend to report high rates of agile method usage. However many of these industrial surveys are conducted by agile consultants, tool vendors, professional societies and independent technology and market research organizations. This raises some important concerns about the possible conflict of interest and the overall trustworthiness of these studies. Objective In response to the above concerns, a secondary study was carried out. Its objective was to examine industrial surveys published in 2011 and 2012, determine the extent to which we could trust their reported high rates of agile method usage and provide recommendations on how quality of research could be improved in the future. Method Following a rigorous search procedure, nine industrial surveys on agile method usage published in 2011 and 2012 were extracted from both academia and industry. Their thoroughness in reporting and trustworthiness were evaluated using a newly proposed assessment framework based on Guba's four attributes of trustworthiness (truth value, applicability, consistency and neutrality) and a number of methods for assessing survey research in related fields as information, communication and management studies. Results The careful examination of the reviewed surveys shows that most of the studies have insufficient thoroughness in reporting and (subsequently) low trustworthiness. Only one (out of nine) study is considered as a scientific contribution in determining the current 2011/2012 rate of agile method usage. Conclusions The obtained results support our initial considerations about the trustworthiness of recent industrial surveys on agile method usage and suggest a number of recommendations for increasing the quality and value of future survey research in this regard. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

We introduce an NLP (Natural Language Process) approach to build EFRFs from documents based on the concept of EFRF and the converting rules.

abstract = {Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) belong to a class of technical measures which aim at preserving the privacy of individuals or groups of individuals. Numerous PETs have been proposed for all kinds of purposes, but are difficult to be compared with each other. The challenge here lies in the fact that information privacy is a comprehensive concept with solutions being diverse, with different focus and aims. As existing taxonomies cover information security-related aspects, while neglecting privacy-specific properties, this work aims at filling this gap by describing a universal taxonomy of PETs where the taxonomy aspects are selected such that they allow the categorization of PETs in different dimensions and properties to cover a wide area of privacy (e.g., user privacy, data privacy). It provides the reader with a tool for the systematic comparison of different PETs. This helps in identifying limitations of existing PETs, complementary technologies, and potential research directions. To demonstrate its applicability, the proposed taxonomy is applied to a set of key technologies covering different disciplines such as data anonymization, privacy-preserving data querying, communication protection, and identity hiding.},

abstract = {GDPR entered into force in May 2018 for enhancing user data protection. Even though GDPR leads towards a radical change with many advantages for the data subjects it turned out to be a significant challenge. Organizations need to make long and complex changes for the personal data processing activities to become GDPR compliant. Citizens as data subjects are empowered with new rights, which however they need to become aware of and understand. Finally, the role of data protection authorities changes as well as their expectations from organizations. GDPR compliance being a challenging matter for the relevant stakeholders calls for a software platform that can support their needs. The aim of the Data govErnance For supportiNg gDpr (DEFeND) EU Project is to deliver such a platform. To succeed, the platform needs to satisfy legal and privacy requirements, be effective in supporting organizations in GDPR compliance, and provide functionalities that data controllers request for supporting GDPR compliance. Further, it needs to satisfy acceptance requirements, for assuring that its users will embrace and use the platform. In this paper, we describe the process, within the DEFeND EU Project, for eliciting and analyzing requirements for such a complex platform, by involving stakeholders from the banking, energy, health and public administration sectors, and using advanced frameworks for privacy requirements and acceptance requirements. The paper also contributes by providing elicited privacy and acceptance requirements concerning a holistic platform for supporting GDPR compliance.},

abstract = {Today's software development is typically driven by incremental changes made to software to implement a new functionality, fix a bug, or improve its performance and security. Each change request is often described as an issue. Recent studies suggest that a set of components (e.g., software modules) relevant to the resolution of an issue is one of the most important information provided with the issue that software engineers often rely on. However, assigning an issue to the correct component(s) is challenging, especially for large-scale projects which have up to hundreds of components. In this paper, we propose a predictive model which learns from historical issue reports and recommends the most relevant components for new issues. Our model uses Long Short-Term Memory, a deep learning technique, to automatically learn semantic features representing an issue report, and combines them with the traditional textual similarity features. An extensive evaluation on 142,025 issues from 11 large projects shows that our approach outperforms one common baseline, two state-of-the-art techniques, and six alternative techniques with an improvement of 16.70{\%}–66.31{\%} on average across all projects in predictive performance.},

@article{Birnhack2014,
abstract = {Policymakers around the world constantly search for new tools to address growing concerns as to informational privacy (data protection). One solution that has gained support in recent years among policy makers is Privacy by Design (PbD). The idea is simple: think of privacy ex ante, and embed privacy within the design of a new technological system, rather than try to fix it ex post, when it is often too late. However, PbD is yet to gain an active role in engineering practices. Thus far, there are only a few success stories. We argue that a major obstacle for PbD is the discursive and conceptual gap between law and technology. A better diagnosis of the gaps between the legal and technological perceptions of privacy is a crucial step in seeking viable solutions. We juxtapose the two fields by reading each field in terms of the other field. We reverse engineer the law, so as to expose its hidden assumptions about technology (the law's technological mindset), and we read canonical technological texts, so as to expose their hidden assumptions about privacy (technology's privacy mindset). Our focus is on one set of informational privacy practices: the large corporation that collects data from individual data subjects. This dual reverse engineering indicates substantial gaps between the legal perception of informational privacy, as reflected in the set of principles commonly known as Fair Information Privacy Principles (FIPPs) and the perceptions of the engineering community. While both information technology and privacy law attempt to regulate the flow of data, they do so in utterly different ways, holding different goals and applying different constraints. The gaps between law and technology point to potential avenues to save PbD.},

abstract = {The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is one of the most demanding and comprehensive privacy regulations of all time. A year after it went into effect, we study its impact on the landscape of privacy policies online. We conduct the first longitudinal, in-depth, and at-scale assessment of privacy policies before and after the GDPR. We gauge the complete consumption cycle of these policies, from the first user impressions until the compliance assessment. We create a diverse corpus of two sets of 6,278 unique English-language privacy policies from inside and outside the EU, covering their pre-GDPR and the post-GDPR versions. The results of our tests and analyses suggest that the GDPR has been a catalyst for a major overhaul of the privacy policies inside and outside the EU. This overhaul of the policies, manifesting in extensive textual changes, especially for the EU-based websites, comes at mixed benefits to the users. While the privacy policies have become considerably longer, our user study with 470 participants on Amazon MTurk indicates a significant improvement in the visual representation of privacy policies from the users' perspective for the EU websites. We further develop a new workflow for the automated assessment of requirements in privacy policies. Using this workflow, we show that privacy policies cover more data practices and are more consistent with seven compliance requirements post the GDPR. We also assess how transparent the organizations are with their privacy practices by performing specificity analysis. In this analysis, we find evidence for positive changes triggered by the GDPR, with the specificity level improving on average. Still, we find the landscape of privacy policies to be in a transitional phase; many policies still do not meet several key GDPR requirements or their improved coverage comes with reduced specificity.},

abstract = {With the increasing concerns over privacy in software systems, there is a growing enthusiasm to develop methods to support the development of privacy aware software systems. Inadequate privacy in software system designs could result in users losing their sensitive data, such as health information and financial information, which may cause financial and reputation loss. Privacy Engineering Methodologies (PEMs) are introduced into the software development processes with the goal of guiding software developers to embed privacy into the systems they design. However, for PEMs to be successful it is imperative that software developers have a positive intention to use PEMs. Otherwise, developers may attempt to bypass the privacy methodologies or use them partially and hence develop software systems that may not protect user privacy appropriately. To investigate the factors that affect software developers' behavioural intention to follow PEMs, in this article, we conducted a study with 149 software developers. Findings of the study show that the usefulness of the PEM to the developers' existing work to be the strongest determinant that affects software developers' intention to follow PEMs. Moreover, the compatibility of the PEM with their way of work and how the PEM demonstrates its results when used were also found to be significant. These findings provide important insights in understanding the behaviour of software developers and how they perceive PEMs. The findings could be used to assist organisations and researchers to deploy PEMs and design PEMs that are positively accepted by software developers.},

abstract = {A major challenge in the field of software engineering is to make users trust the software that they use in their every day activities for professional or recreational reasons. Trusting software depends on various elements, one of which is the protection of user privacy. Protecting privacy is about complying with user's desires when it comes to handling personal information. Users' privacy can also be defined as the right to determine when, how and to what extend information about them is communicated to others. Current research stresses the need for addressing privacy issues during the system design rather than during the system implementation phase. To this end, this paper describes PriS, a security requirements engineering method, which incorporates privacy requirements early in the system development process. PriS considers privacy requirements as organisational goals that need to be satisfied and adopts the use of privacy-process patterns as a way to: (1) describe the effect of privacy requirements on business processes; and (2) facilitate the identification of the system architecture that best supports the privacy-related business processes. In this way, PriS provides a holistic approach from 'high-level; goals to 'privacy-compliant' IT systems. The PriS way-of-working is formally defined thus, enabling the development of automated tools for assisting its application. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag London Limited 2008.},

Objective The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the SLRs on ASD research topics for software engineering researchers and practitioners. Method We followed the tertiary study guidelines by Kitchenham et al. to find SLRs published between late 1990s to December 2015. Results We found 28 SLRs focusing on ten different ASD research areas: adoption, methods, practices, human and social aspects, CMMI, usability, global software engineering (GSE), organizational agility, embedded systems, and software product line engineering. The number of SLRs on ASD topics, similar to those on software engineering (SE) topics in general, is on the rise. A majority of the SLRs applied standardized guidelines and the quality of these SLRs on ASD topics was found to be slightly higher for journal publications than for conferences. While some individuals and institutions seem to lead this area, the spread of authors and institutions is wide. With respect to prior review recommendations, significant progress was noticed in the area of connecting agile to established domains such as usability, CMMI, and GSE; and considerable progress was observed in focusing on management-oriented approaches as Scrum and sustaining ASD in different contexts such as embedded systems. Conclusion SLRs of ASD studies are on the rise and cover a variety of ASD aspects, ranging from early adoption issues to newer applications of ASD such as in product line engineering. ASD research can benefit from further primary and secondary studies on evaluating benefits and challenges of ASD methods, agile hybrids in large-scale setups, sustainability, motivation, teamwork, and project management; as well as a fresh review of empirical studies in ASD to cover the period post 2008.},

abstract = {Pervasive use of software applications continue to challenge user privacy when users interact with software systems. Even though privacy practices such as Privacy by Design (PbD), have clear instructions for software developers to embed privacy into software designs, those practices are yet to become a common practice among software developers. The difficulty of developing privacy preserving software systems highlights the importance of investigating software developers and the problems they face when they are asked to embed privacy into application designs. Software developers are the community who can put practices such as PbD into action. Therefore identifying the problems they face when embedding privacy into software applications and providing solutions to those problems are important to enable the development of privacy preserving software systems. This study investigates 36 software developers in a software design task with instructions to embed privacy in order to identify the problems they face. We derive recommendation guidelines to address the problems to enable the development of privacy preserving software systems.},

abstract = {Ready or not, the digitalization of information has come, and privacy is standing out there, possibly at stake. Although digital privacy is an identified priority in our society, few systematic, effective methodologies exist that deal with privacy threats thoroughly. This paper presents a comprehensive framework to model privacy threats in software-based systems. First, this work provides a systematic methodology to model privacy-specific threats. Analogous to STRIDE, an information flow-oriented model of the system is leveraged to guide the analysis and to provide broad coverage. The methodology instructs the analyst on what issues should be investigated, and where in the model those issues could emerge. This is achieved by (i) defining a list of privacy threat types and (ii) providing the mappings between threat types and the elements in the system model. Second, this work provides an extensive catalog of privacy-specific threat tree patterns that can be used to detail the threat analysis outlined above. Finally, this work provides the means to map the existing privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) to the identified privacy threats. Therefore, the selection of sound privacy countermeasures is simplified. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

abstract = {The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) harmonizes data privacy laws and regulations across Europe. Through the GDPR, individuals are able to better control their personal data in the face of new technological developments. While the GDPR is highly advantageous to individuals, complying with it poses major challenges for organizations that control or process personal data. Since no automated solution with broad industrial applicability currently exists for GDPR compliance checking, organizations have no choice but to perform costly manual audits to ensure compliance. In this paper, we share our experience building a UML representation of the GDPR as a first step towards the development of future automated methods for assessing compliance with the GDPR. Given that a concrete implementation of the GDPR is affected by the national laws of the EU member states, GDPR's expanding body of case law and other contextual information, we propose a two-tiered representation of the GDPR: a generic tier and a specialized tier. The generic tier captures the concepts and principles of the GDPR that apply to all contexts, whereas the specialized tier describes a specific tailoring of the generic tier to a given context, including the contextual variations that may impact the interpretation and application of the GDPR. We further present the challenges we faced in our modeling endeavor, the lessons we learned from it, and future directions for research.},

abstract = {Privacy policies are critical for helping individuals make informed decisions about their personal data. In Europe, privacy policies are subject to compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If done entirely manually, checking whether a given privacy policy complies with GDPR is both time-consuming and error-prone. Automated support for this task is thus advantageous. At the moment, there is an evident lack of such support on the market. In this paper, we tackle an important dimension of GDPR compliance checking for privacy policies. Specifically, we provide automated support for checking whether the content of a given privacy policy is complete according to the provisions stipulated by GDPR. To do so, we present: (1) a conceptual model to characterize the information content envisaged by GDPR for privacy policies, (2) an AI-assisted approach for classifying the information content in GDPR privacy policies and subsequently checking how well the classified content meets the completeness criteria of interest; and (3) an evaluation of our approach through a case study over 24 unseen privacy policies. For classification, we leverage a combination of Natural Language Processing and supervised Machine Learning. Our experimental material is comprised of 234 real privacy policies from the fund industry. Our empirical results indicate that our approach detected 45 of the total of 47 incompleteness issues in the 24 privacy policies it was applied to. Over these policies, the approach had eight false positives. The approach thus has a precision of 85{\%} and recall of 96{\%} over our case study.},

abstract = {Privacy is a concept in disarray. Nobody can articulate what it means. As one commentator has observed, privacy suffers from "an embarrassment of meanings." Privacy is far too vague a concept to guide adjudication and lawmaking, as abstract incantations of the importance of "privacy" do not fare well when pitted against more concretely stated countervailing interests. In 1960, the famous torts scholar William Prosser attempted to make sense of the landscape of privacy law by identifying four different interests. But Prosser focused only on tort law, and the law of information privacy is significantly more vast and complex, extending to Fourth Amendment law, the constitutional right to information privacy, evidentiary privileges, dozens of federal privacy statutes, and hundreds of state statutes. Moreover, Prosser wrote over 40 years ago, and new technologies have given rise to a panoply of new privacy harms. A new taxonomy to understand privacy violations is thus sorely needed. This Article develops a taxonomy to identify privacy problems in a comprehensive and concrete manner. It endeavors to guide the law toward a more coherent understanding of privacy and to serve as a framework for the future development of the field of privacy law.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been an increase of reported privacy threats hitting large software systems. These threats can originate from stakeholders that are part of the system. Thus, it is crucial for software engineers to identify these privacy threats, refine these into privacy requirements, and design solutions that mitigate the threats. In this paper, we introduce our methodology named Problem-Based Privacy Analysis (ProPAn). The ProPAn method is an approach for identifying privacy threats during the requirements analysis of software systems using problem frame models. Our approach does not rely entirely on the privacy analyst to detect privacy threats, but allows a computer aided privacy threat identification that is derived from the relations between stakeholders, technology, and personal information in the system-to-be. To capture the environment of the system, e.g., stakeholders and other IT systems, we use problem frames, a requirements engineering approach founded on the modeling of a machine (system-to-be) in its environment (e.g. stakeholders, other software). We define a UML profile for privacy requirements and a reasoning technique that identifies stakeholders, whose personal information are stored or transmitted in the system-to-be and stakeholders fromwhom we have to protect this personal information. We illustrate our approach using an eHealth scenario provided by the industrial partners of the EU project NESSoS.},

This has led to tools and services that promise compliance to GDPR in terms of consent management and keeping track of personal data being processed. The information recorded within such tools, as well as that for compliance itself, needs to be interoperable to provide sufficient transparency in its usage. Additionally, interoperability is also necessary towards addressing the right to data portability under GDPR as well as creation of user-configurable and manageable privacy policies. We argue that such interoperability can be enabled through agreement over vocabularies using linked data principles. The W3C Data Privacy Vocabulary and Controls Community Group (DPVCG) was set up to jointly develop such vocabularies towards interoperability in the context of data privacy. This paper presents the resulting Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV), along with a discussion on its potential uses, and an invitation for feedback and participation.},

abstract = {Software developers are trained to develop and design software applications that provide services to users. However, software applications sometimes collect users' data without their knowledge. When applications collect and use users' data without transparency, this leads to user privacy invasions because users do not expect the application to collect and use these information. Therefore, it is important that software developers understand users' privacy expectations when designing applications in order to handle user data transparently in software applications. However, due to the lack of systematic approaches to extract user privacy requirements, developers end up designing applications either based on their assumptions on user privacy expectations, or relating to their own expectations of privacy as a user. Nevertheless, how accurate these perceived privacy expectations are against actual user expectations is not currently known. This research focuses on investigating developers' privacy expectations from a user point of view against users' privacy expectations. We also investigate developers' assumptions on user privacy expectations against actual user privacy expectations. Our findings revealed that developers' assumptions on user privacy expectations are close to their own expectations of privacy from a user point of view and that developers' privacy expectations from a user point of view are significantly different from actual user privacy expectations. With this understanding, we provide recommendations for software developers to understand and acknowledge user expectations on privacy when they design and develop applications.},

abstract = {Companies that collect personal information online often maintain privacy policies that are required to accurately reflect their data practices and privacy goals. To be comprehensive and flexible for future practices, policies contain ambiguity that summarizes practices over multiple types of products and business contexts. Ambiguity in data practice descriptions undermines policies as an effective way to communicate system design choices to users and as a reliable regulatory mechanism. In this paper, we report an investigation to identify incompleteness by representing data practice descriptions as semantic frames. The approach is a grounded analysis to discover which semantic roles corresponding to a data action are needed to construct complete data practice descriptions. Our results include 698 data action instances obtained from 949 manually annotated statements across 15 privacy policies and three domains: health, news and shopping. Therein, we identified 2316 instances of 17 types of semantic roles and found that the distribution of semantic roles across the three domains was similar. Incomplete data practice descriptions undermine user comprehension and can affect the user's perceived privacy risk, which we measure using factorial vignette surveys. We observed that user risk perception decreases when two roles are present in a statement: the condition under which a data action is performed, and the purpose for which the user's information is used.},

As issue tracking systems also contain bug reports or programming tasks, the software feature requests of the users are often difficult to identify.

It compares traditional linguistic machine learning features, such as "bag of words", with more advanced features, such as subject-action-object, and evaluates combinations of machine learning features derived from the natural language and features taken from the issue tracking system meta-data. Our investigation shows that some combinations of machine learning features derived from natural language and the issue tracking system meta-data outperform traditional approaches. We show that issues or data fields (e.g. descriptions or comments), which contain software feature requests, can be identified reasonably well, but hardly the exact sentence. Finally, we show that the choice of machine learning algorithms should depend on the goal, e.g. maximization of the detection rate or balance between detection rate and precision.

abstract = {Increasingly, medical records are being stored in computer databases that allow for efficiencies in providing treatment and in the processing of clinical and financial services. Computerization of medical records has also diminished patient privacy and, in particular, has increased the potential for misuse, especially in the form of nonconsensual secondary use of personally identifiable records. Organizations that store and use medical records have had to establish security measures, prompted partially by an inconsistent patchwork of legal standards that vary from state to state. There is widespread appreciation among policy makers regarding the need for legal reform. The Health Information and Portability Accountability Act of 1996 mandated that the Administration develop regulations regarding the control of medical records. The Administration has offered regulations from the Department of Health and Human Services (Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information; Proposed Rule 45 CFR Parts 160 through 164). Survey data reveal what healthcare professionals who have access to sensitive medical records believe are the greatest threats to patients' privacy. The overlap between Administration proposals and the responses of healthcare professionals is striking.$\backslash$nBaumer, D., Earp, J. B., and Payton, F. C. 2000.

@article{Spiekermann2009,
abstract = {In this paper we integrate insights from diverse islands of research on electronic privacy to offer a holistic view of privacy engineering and a systematic structure for the discipline's topics. First we discuss privacy requirements grounded in both historic and contemporary perspectives on privacy. We use a three-layer model of user privacy concerns to relate them to system operations (data transfer, storage and processing) and examine their effects on user behavior. In the second part of the paper we develop guidelines for building privacy-friendly systems. We distinguish two approaches: "privacy-by-policy" and "privacy-by-architecture." The privacy-by-policy approach focuses on the implementation of the notice and choice principles of fair information practices (FIPs), while the privacy-by-architecture approach minimizes the collection of identifiable personal data and emphasizes anonymization and client-side data storage and processing. We discuss both approaches with a view to their technical overlaps and boundaries as well as to economic feasibility. The paper aims to introduce engineers and computer scientists to the privacy research domain and provide concrete guidance on how to design privacy-friendly systems. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Information systems are increasingly distributed and pervasive, enabling organizations to deliver remote services and share personal information, worldwide. However, developers face significant challenges in managing the many laws that govern their systems in this multi-jurisdictional environment. In this paper, we report on a computational requirements document expressible using a legal requirements specification language (LRSL). The purpose is to make legal requirements open and available to policy makers, business analysts and software developers, alike. We show how requirements engineers can codify policy and law using the LRSL and design, debug, analyze, trace, and visualize relationships among regulatory requirements. The LRSL provides new constructs for expressing distributed constraints, making regulatory specification patterns visually salient, and enabling metrics to quantitatively measure different styles for writing legal and policy documents. We discovered and validated the LRSL using thirteen U.S. state data breach notification laws.},

Although the research community has made significant progress in theory and in labs, meltdowns in recent years suggest that we're still struggling to address systemic privacy issues. Privacy engineering, an emerging field, responds to this gap between research and practice. It's concerned with systematizing and evaluating approaches to capture and address privacy issues with engineering information systems. This article serves to illuminate this nascent field. The authors provide a definition of privacy engineering and describe encompassing activities. They expand on these with findings from the First International Workshop on Privacy Engineering (IWPE), and conclude with future challenges.},

However, on the technical plane, a profusion of privacy-oriented guidelines and approaches coexists, which provides partial solutions to the overall problem and AIDS engineers during different stages of the system development lifecycle. As a result, engineers find difficult to understand what they should do to make their systems abide by privacy by design, thus hindering the adoption of privacy engineering practices. This paper reviews existing best practices in the analysis and design stages of the system development lifecycle, introduces a systematic methodology for privacy engineering that merges and integrates them, leveraging their best features whilst addressing their weak points, and describes its alignment with current standardization efforts.},

Privacy practices (e.g. Data Minimisation (DM), Privacy by Design (PbD) or General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) and related 'privacy engineering' methodologies exist and provide clear instructions for developers to implement privacy into software systems they develop that preserve user privacy. However, those practices and methodologies are not yet a common practice in the software development community there has been no previous research focused on developing 'educational' interventions such as serious games to enhance software developers' coding behaviour therefore, this research proposes a game design framework as an educational tool for software developers to improve (secure) coding behaviour, so they can develop privacy-preserving software applications that people can use the elements of the proposed framework were incorporated into a gaming application scenario that enhances the software developers' coding behaviour through their motivation the proposed work not only enables the development of privacy-preserving software systems but also helping the software development community to put privacy guidelines and engineering methodologies into practice.},

@article{Breaux2006,
abstract = {In the United States, federal and state regulations prescribe stakeholder rights and obligations that must be satisfied by the requirements for software systems. These regulations are typically wrought with ambiguities, making the process of deriving system requirements ad hoc and error prone. In highly regulated domains such as healthcare, there is a need for more comprehensive standards that can be used to assure that system requirements conform to regulations. To address this need, we expound upon a process called Semantic Parameterization previously used to derive rights and obligations from privacy goals. In this work, we apply the process to the Privacy Rule from the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). We present our methodology for extracting and prioritizing rights and obligations from regulations and show how semantic models can be used to clarify ambiguities through focused elicitation and to balance rights with obligations. The results of our analysis can aid requirements engineers, standards organizations, compliance officers, and stakeholders in assuring systems conform to policy and satisfy requirements. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},
