Facebook says cookies not enabled, and thus you cannot log in.

Inspecting which cookies are allowed with and without the ""Session only"" setting reveals cookies that aren't sent as session only by facebook are BLOCKED when the ""Session only"" setting is set.

This is a non-intuitive behaviour - Chrome should CONVERT non-session cookies to being session only. This would then match Firefox's behaviour, and what I believe is the intuitive behaviour.

1. In a normal window, log into a site (such as Google).
2. Open a new incognito window
3. In the normal window, Right click on a link (such as ""Images""), and select ""Open Link in Incognito Window"".
5. In the Incognito window, select the newly created Google tab.
6. In the Incognito window, open a new tab and go to Google. Notice that only the new tab is not logged in.

What happens instead?

You can now get two tabs opened side-by-side in the same incognito window with different cookies. The non-incognito state propagates even to manually entered URLs, so any page loaded in this tab could access cookies from the non-incognito window.

83765,WebRequest API allows extensions to manipulate web store pages,"VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Using the webrequest API, extensions can redirect files in the web store (for example, javascript files) to other files that do malicious things.
The attached extension redirects the Google Analytics file to one within the extension, causing an app/extension to be installed whenever the user clicks somewhere on the web store page (as the web store cannot install items without user interaction).

86108,Security: FileSystem API can be used to learn about installed software on the user's computer,"FileSystem API can be used to learn about installed software on the user's computer.

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

Files created in the local sandboxed filesystem have an associated mime type (exposed via Blob.type). The mime type is determined by analyzing the file extension if present. Chrome has a table of well known file extensions, but when it encounters a file extension that it does not know, it consults the registry (or other OS equivalents). This can reveal whether software for a particular file extension / mime type is installed on the user's system.

This seems like both a privacy leak (can be used to fingerprint users), and it also carries the risk of revealing to a potential attacker the set of available software on the system that could be targetted for other exploits (i.e., get the user to download a .foo file in hopes of exploiting FooEditor.exe).

VERSION
Starting with Chrome 13, any web page can perform this attack by creating files silently in the temporary file system. In previous versions of Chrome, only an installed app was able to use the file system API.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

86308,QuotaManager should provide support for BrowsingDataRemover to handle quota-managed storage types properly,"There's been some discussion around how the BrowsingDataRemover should handle data deletion with time constraings (e.g. ""Obliterate the following items from: the past xxx""), but current agreement is like: we should delete the entire origin data if any data of the origin has been touched in the given timeframe.

To achieve this cleanly the quota manager could provide two additional interfaces like following:

void GetOriginsModifiedSince(StorageType /*pers vs temp*/, date_time,
callback);
void DeleteOriginData(StorageType, origin, callback);

This would make it possible for BDR to handle all quota managed storaged types in a consistent way.

The SSL session cache should be something that can be cleared on demand (via Under the Hood -> Clear Browsing Data), as it represents state similar to the HTTP auth cache or cookies (when used for authentication data). In addition to clearing the SSL session cache, this should also clear the SSL client certificate cache, as clearing one without the other would prevent the use case from being realized.

The use case for this feature is to allow a user to switch identities/""log out"" of a site protected by SSL client certificate authentication. As currently implemented, the user must restart the browser entirely to log out.

This is somewhat related to Issue 30877/Issue 72772 (as clearing the cache per-profile would necessary require per-profile caches, allowing a per-incognito cache) and Issue 29784, which would need such selective clearing for a ""log out"" type function.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0

98441,Reporting mis-detected languages exposes https urls over http,"VULNERABILITY DETAILS
The option to report that Chrome has mis-detected the language of a page causes the full url to be transmitted in an unencrypted http query string. When the mis-detected page was accessed over https, the action of reporting mis-detection violates the expectation that https urls visited by the user will not be transmitted over http.

VERSION
Chrome Version: 16.0.891.0 dev
Operating System: OS X 10.6.8

REPRODUCTION CASE
Visit a page over https that is not in a language specified by the user (Preferences > Under the Hood > Languages and Spell-checker Settings) so that the ""This page is in (language) Would you like to translate it?"" bar appears.
With my languages as [English (United States), English], the French Wikipedia landing page works reliably: https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fr/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Accueil_principal

From the Options menu on the bar, select the ""Not in (language)? Report this error"" item.

For the example above, this opens the following url in a new tab: http://translate.google.com/translate_error?client=cr&action=langidc&u=https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fr/wiki/Wikip%25C3%25A9dia:Accueil_principal&sl=fr&hl=en

Note that the specific page I was viewing has now been exposed to the local network. If the mis-detected url had included a security token or session id, that too would have been exposed.

Also note that the url is incorrectly represented on the page as being an ""http"" url with a specified port of 443: ""The web page at http://secure.wikimedia.org:443/wikipedia/fr/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Accueil_principal was detected as French.""

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Set options to block all plug-ins
2. Attempt to open a local file in chrome that requires a plugin (IE: pdf), note plugin is blocked
3. Set to always allow plugin from that location. Reopen file, note it now works.
4. Attempt to change the file name to a wildcard to allow files open from the directory (IE: change ""file:///C:/foo/bar.pdf"" to ""file:///c:/foo/*""). Note C:/ is dropped.
5. Attempt to open similar file (IE: Another Pdf) from the directory, plugin does not work.

What is the expected result?
Expect to be able to add file:///C:/* to plugin exceptions to allow local files to be allowed to run plugins.

What happens instead?
The file:///C:/ removes the C:/, and this causes local files that require plugins to not work.

Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if
possible.

File:/// is what's messing things up. I don't know why file:///C:/* is automatically changed. I have tried file:///* to allow plugins, but this also fails.

- Block third-party cookies from being set

2. I already had 3 exceptions, one for [*.]google.co.uk, one for [*.]google.com, and one for my own domain. Nothing was added to or removed from this list.

3. I tried at another domain, uk.yahoo.com, and saw the same behaviour, so it is not limited to one site.

4. Oddly, I only see the blocked cookie icon at www.blogger.com/home if I refresh the page. If I focus the URL and press Enter, the icon does not appear.

Probably most importantly:
5. When clicking the blocked cookie icon, the 'always allow' radio button is selected by default. Clicking 'Continue blocking cookies' and then 'Always allow' before then clicking 'Done' has no effect. However, clicking 'Continue blocking', then 'Done', then the blocked cookie icon again, then 'Always allow', and then 'Done' does result in an exception being added (for ""[*.]www.blogger.com"").

information below. Include an URL demonstrating the issue and attach a

affects your privacy.

One friend asked my if it is possible to remove one single page from the suggestions in omnibox history. So i made a test with a clear chromium profil. 

I opened to pages. google.de and chromium.org and mozilla.com/mozilla.org

after that i removed google.de and mozilla.com/mozilla.org via chrome://history, but kept youtube. i also removed google.de and mozilla.com/mozilla.org cookies

when i entered g into omnibox it suggested me google.de again. 

So i looked into the history files in the profile and noticed the following. 

google.de and mozilla.com/mozilla.org was still stored in that files (view via a sqlite client or inside notepad++):
-Favicons
-History
-History Index 2012-01
-History Provider Cache
-Shortcuts

i have attached several screenshot.

I think it is a privacy issue because a third person could restore deleted history, when he has got a copy of the files.

118914,Audit of URLFetchers to respect content settings for cookies,"We are conducting an audit for all uses of URLFetchers to respect the content settings for cookies (i.e. permission to send / save cookies). Some of the URLFetchers may not need cookies at all.

Please follow these instructions:


If a URLFetcher uses a profile URLRequestContext
================================================

Option 1 (preferred): Disable sending and saving cookies.
Reach out to the server side team and figure out whether they are ok with not receiving cookies. Then set the load flags net::LOAD_DO_NOT_SEND_COOKIES and net::LOAD_DO_NOT_SAVE_COOKIES via URLFetcher::SetLoadFlags.

Option 2: If the URLFetcher needs cookies and lives in the context of a tab, this code has to follow the content settings of the profile.
In order to follow the content settings of the profile, plumb the WebContents to the URLFetcher via 
URLFetcher::AssociateWithRenderView(
web_contents->GetURL(),
web_contents->GetRenderProcessHost()->GetID(),
web_contents->GetRenderViewHost()->GetRoutingID()). 
The web_contents->GetURL() is used as ""first party"" for cookie checks. Make sure that this is correct for the service in question.

If cookies are blocked due to content settings, the user is warned with a ""Blocked cookies"" indicator in the URL bar.

Option 3: If the URLFetcher needs cookies but can't be associated to a tab contents.
Start a discussion with chrome-privacy, chrome-ui-reviews, and the service owner on whether silently failing is ok, or whether we need some special UI.


If a URLFetcher uses a system URLRequestContext
===============================================

Option 1 (preferred): Reach out to the server team and add the load flags to disable cookies as described above.

Option 2: Start a discussion on chrome-privacy@ (incl. the server owners) on why it's ok to send and store cookies here.


If a URLFetcher uses its own URLRequestContext
==============================================

Please start a discussion with the service owner and chrome-privacy whether it is possible to use one of the two options above. Note that if you use your own URLRequestContext, cookies are disabled now.

(Testing on window 7 / perpper 18 / GlibC / many different chrome versions)

We're facing several issues with Local Storage :

1 - With latest stable version (chrome 18.0.1025.151), there is a problem with quota management. With a clean profile, I request 1 GB of local storage. If I request the current usage with window.webkitStorageInfo.queryUsageAndQuota I get 0 Byte (correct!).
After launching my application, I get 260 MB so it's correct too.
But if I clean my cache in the browser, I can see that ""User Data\Default\File System"" directory is well cleaned but queryUsageAndQuota still returns 260 MB instead of 0. With an older chromium version 18.0.1025.39) it's working fine.

2 - With Chrome Canary (chrome 20.0.1096.1). We get a Not Enough Space error whatever quota we requested. We don't have this problem with chrome 19.

3 - When trying to produce a simple test example, we noticed
that the pong example is not working using pepper 18 whatever Chrome version you're using. The same example from chrome web store (http://gonativeclient.appspot.com/dev/demos/sdk_examples/) is working fine.

Chrome OS Version: ALL OS
API: chrome.contentSettings
OS: Tested on Win7 and Mac OS X
Please specify Area-* of the system to which this bug/feature applies (add the label below).

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create a large domain list (700 +) (blockList in my example below);
2. loop through the code and add via your addon:
$.each(blockList, function () {
var setting = 'block';
var pattern = ""*://*."" + this.domain + ""/*"";
chrome.contentSettings['cookies'].set({
'primaryPattern': pattern,
'setting': setting,
'scope': (incognito ? 'incognito_session_only' : regular')
});
});
3. run.

Expected Result:
Block list is added to the user's Content Settings.

Actual Result:
-Chrome slows down, locks up all tabs and eventually fails. Adding images and JS to the loop/block process increases instability. Feels like a memory/resource issue, seems worse when Chrome Tools are open.

How frequently does this problem reproduce? (Always, sometimes, hard to reproduce?) 
-Always

What is the impact to the user, and is there a workaround? If so, what is it? 
-I have been regularly successful with lists that are smaller than 400 domains.

1) Start with a fresh profile.

3) Wait for topsites to update to show the page you visited.
4) Clear browsing data, all types, from the beginning of time.

After clearing browsing data, the topsites entry for the bookmarked page stays visible.

The root cause is that we appear to be deleting entries from the visits table, but we leave the entry in the urls table (because the url is bookmarked). Somehow this is also causing us to keep the entries in the segments and segment_usage tables, which causes the topsites entry to stick around. We should probably also delete segments in this case.

This bug was uncovered by r150531 (https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/10830210), which changed the BrowsingDataRemover to explicitly specify a delete_end time. Previously, we passed ""0"" for both delete_begin and delete_end, which went through a special case in ExpireHistoryBackend which simply dropped the whole history db.

The ""Clear Browsing Data"" feature allows user to delete their history of visited sites. This only works partly, while Chrome shows an empty history, the ""Preferences"" file in the Chrome profile directory still contains a list of visited domain names. This way, a user's surf history can be reconstructed if an attacker has permission to read the user's browser profile, which is a privacy problem especially on computers used by multiple users (family computers, public computers etc.).

VERSION

Chrome Version: 21.0.1180.89 stable, using the package from google.com
Operating System: Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS

REPRODUCTION STEPS

1. Visit a website that supports SYDY (e.g google.com, youtube.com)
2. Take a look at Chrome's history. The website should be listed there.
3. Run ""Clear Browsing Data"". Make sure you tick the checkbox which clears the history.
4. Now look again at Chrome's history, all enries should be deleted.
5. Close Chrome and go to your profile directory. On my machine, it's ~/.config/google-chrome.
6. In the subfolder ""Default"" is a JSON file named ""Preferences"". Search with your text editor for ""http_server_properties"". You will get a list of all SPDY-enabled domains you have visited.

FIX SUGGESTION

Change the ""Clear Browsing Data"" function so it deletes the ""http_server_properties"" list too.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Use a Chrome dev version with the latest new tab page, which puts the google search box in the middle of the New Tab page.
2. Make sure the following boxes in the Settings menu are turned off: ""Enable Instant for faster searching"" and ""Use a prediction service to help complete searches and URLs typed in the address bar.""

Autocomplete only using previously used keywords and URLs from the local database, without going out over the network to get new words to autocomplete with.

What went wrong?

Did this work before? Yes Yesterday

But this new behavior clearly breaks user expectations for the two Settings listed. If the intent is to back out the new Embedded Search functionality soon after a short trial run, no big deal, but if it's here to stay it needs to respect the settings that disallowed autocomplete using Google services over the internet before.

172228,Security: POST data sent to the wrong page after a refresh on a 500 Internal Server Error redirection target page,"VULNERABILITY DETAILS

Scenario: a web page receives user's input using POST, then redirects the user to another URL.

page_a.php INPUT form => POST to page_b.php => redirect to page_c.php

If the redirection target page (page_c.php) raises a 500 Internal Server Error and the user hits the Refresh button, the browser displays the ""Confirm form resubmission"", afterwards sends user input data to page_c.php.

I could reproduce this behaviour even if pages were on different domains.

IMHO this behaviour could lead to personal data and credentials disclosure, for example on OAuth2 single sign-on processes, where authentication is performed by content provider and then user is redirected to another website.

VERSION

Chrome Version: 24.0.1312.56 m Stable

Operating System: Windows XP Professional Service Pack 3

REPRODUCTION CASE

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Clear all bookmarks, history, and stored data on Chrome
2. Start Chrome with the flag --user-data-dir=<folder> , where <folder> is an empty folder other than the one Chrome normally uses. Click past Issue 174590.
3. Close Chrome
4. Navigate to <folder>/Default/
5. View with SQLite Browser or text editor the files ""History Index YYYY-MM."" where YYYY-MM represents last month and this month
6. Notice URLs and URL-formatted local filenames (file://) in the history indexes

What is the expected behavior?
If I create a new user directory from scratch and immediately examine it, I expect any history files within it to be empty of URLs. I especially expect it to be empty of local filenames from last month.

What went wrong?
Starting Chrome with a blank User Data directory causes it to create a Default profile containing History Index files for this month and last month. The History Index files contain URLs and local filenames accessed on the computer during those months.

Did this work before? N/A 

Chrome version: 24.0.1312.57 Channel: stable
OS Version: 5.1 (Windows XP)

Some of the saved filenames were recently downloaded with Chrome while others were not. I'm quite certain that at least a few of these were never downloaded or typed into the omnibox.

I have no idea where the information for these newly-created files is coming from. It isn't coming from the History Index of my usual Chrome user directory, as that doesn't even have a History Index for last month, nor does the History Index it does have contain any of these file names.

In any case, all of these filenames were last accessed *before* the new user directory was ever created. Their presence in the index is definitely not ""expected behavior"".

While I'm sure this behavior is a boon for forensic investigators in criminal cases, it would also be helpful to the security agency of an authoritarian country. I expect Chrome to be fully transparent about what information it collects and stores.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0

177490,"If you pin a profile shortcut to the taskbar, it won't get deleted on profile deletion","Per discussion with gab@ on https://codereview.chromium.org/12319020/ and with some investigation, it seems like there's no good solution here.

The (undocumented) API we currently use to unpin taskbar shortcuts (which is ShellExecute(""taskbarunpin"") in shortcut.cc), is not able to differentiate between profile and non-profile shortcuts, even if we set an appid on the shortcut. For example, if a non-profile shortcut gets pinned and we call the API on a profile shortcut, then the non-profile shortcut also gets deleted.

With the change in https://codereview.chromium.org/12330026/, we don't unpin anything from the taskbar anymore on profile shortcut deletion, which fixes the above issue, but makes it so that if you had manually pinned a profile shortcut from the desktop, it will not get removed from the taskbar when the profile is deleted.

Setting different AppIds on the shortcuts does not help, so unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a good way to solve this other than:
a) manually pinning/unpinning things instead of using ShellExecute(""taskbarunpin""), which apparently causes other problems according to gab
b) inspecting what was what pinned before, then unpinning all the shortcuts using the API and then pinning-back the ones that should have been kept
d) having proxy exe targets for each profile, so that ShellExecute(""taskbarunpin"") can distinguish them, that just redirect to the main chrome exe (eww)
c) finding a different API that does what we need

None of these options seem particularly attractive. :\",1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Steps to reproduce the problem:
Method A:

1. Open the Clear Browser Data dialog (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+Del)
2. Repeat step 1 within 24 hours

Method B:
1. Open the History page (e.g., Ctrl+H)
2. Check the box next to an item
3. Click the Remove Selected Items button

What is the expected behavior?
Chrome should display the Clear Browsing Data or History Item Removal dialogs in a neutral, professional manner.

What went wrong?
Chrome displays condescending messages that talk down to users and practically accuse them of illicit behavior.

Did this work before? Yes Older versions (dont know the exact version).

Chrome version: 26.0.1410.64 Channel: n/a
OS Version: 6.1 (Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2)

In the past, Chrome would behave like a professional when users request the Clear Browser Data dialog or remove items from the History page. Unfortunately more recent versions (twenty-something and up) throw a demeaning and accusatory message in your face when you open the dialogs:

> Psst! Incognito mode (Ctrl+Shift+N) may come in handy next time.

In addition to presuming that users are novices and dont know how to use Chrome, in this context, the suggestion that users use Incognito mode implies that the user has summoned the dialog in order to cover their tracks and erase evidence of their illicit browsing activities such as visiting unsavory sites.

This is absurd because there are plenty of reasons that a user may open the dialog, such as flushing the cache or cookies in order to get a misbehaving page to work correctly. I can only imagine how many web-developers are faced with this message countless times each and every day!

Even erasing an item from the history is not necessarily due to misdeeds on the users part. For example, many users have Googled some topic and opened the first several pages in the search results, then later noticed that one of them was at a site that they would prefer not to have listed in their history. (Anybody who is snooping through the history is unlikely to view the other sites surrounding a site visit and will instead just use keywords, which indicate the mere existence of the visit rather that than the context.) So it is ridiculous to assume that a user always plans visits to undesirable sites ahead of time in order to use Incognito mode.

It is one thing for Chrome to have personality and be a little quirky (e.g., Sad Chrome pages), but this message goes too far.

At the *very least*, this message should be displayed only once, not every day and certainly not EVERY TIME the dialogs are opened each day. It would be even better to remove it altogether because there are better and less insulting ways to educate users about Incognito mode if that was the goal of the message.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0

OS: Windows

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Sync a bunch of autofill data
2. From settings, clear autofill
3. Wait 2-3 hours

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected: deletion propagates to other clients and server.
Actual: autofill entries come back down after a few hours

Details from ConOps:
1) Clearing cache, cookies and autofill doesn't help - all data comes back after restart.
2) Selecting autofill data and pressing Shift+Delete deletes data permanently.
3) If autofill is NOT synced, the problem is not observed.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
252217,Cookie deletion on behalf of user request shouldn't return until deletion has been sync'd to on-disk cookie store,"Steps to reproduce the problem:
While investigating an Opera (for Android) cookie bug I found that CookieMonster::InternalDeleteCookie() doesn't seem to do what it claims to do. There's a bool sync_to_store which will cause store_->DeleteCookie(*cc) to be called, but the implementation (SQLitePersistentCookieStore::Backend::DeleteCookie) isn't synchronous, it just batches operations for later. However, CookieMonster::DeleteAllCreatedBetweenTask, which uses InternalDeleteCookie, doesn't wait for the sync to disk, it just calls the ""done"" callback.

Given that BrowsingDataRemover uses these code paths, the result is that it can report being done even though the cookies are still on disk.

What is the expected behavior?
If BrowsingDataRemover reports being done, the data should really be gone, even if the browser isn't shut down properly.

What went wrong?
If the browser crashes or is forcefully killed at that point, the cookies will remain on restart.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Start typing an address in the address bar (e.g ""facebook.com"").
2. Once a request is sent by the prediction service (e.g after typing ""fa""), and BEFORE its response is returned to the browser, use the first suggestion from the omnibox autocompletion by hitting enter. This step is a bit tricky and difficult to reproduce since it has to be done fast enough (links of videos demonstrating slow and fast enough executions are specified below).
3. Go to the address bar, start typing the same URL as in the previous step and select the same suggestion as before. 

What is the expected behavior?
Let T1 be the time in which a response held by the prediction service was returned. Such response should only be used to satisfy a request that was sent in time T2 if T2 > T1 (otherwise, a new request must be sent).

What went wrong?
Consider this two use cases demonstrated by the following short videos:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/6asbmz53zjbigo8/UC1.mov
https://www.dropbox.com/s/vw5g7kkk5iqo2jc/UC2.mov

In the first one, the user is slow enough and hits enter only after the request that is sent by the prediction service is satisfied. Such use case leads to the desired behaviour and everything works great. 
However, as seen in the second video, the user might be fast enough to initiate a request before the one sent by the prediction service is satisfied. In such use case, expired content might be displayed to the user, such as in the example which shows how the content of a logged-in user is show to an unauthenticated one.

What is the expected behavior?
Expected behavior is to have each cookie space completely exclusive.

What went wrong?
From HTTPS Everywhere: Were getting the onCookieChanged event, and the cookie we get in that event has a storeId of 0 regardless of where it comes from (Incognito or not). We then turn right around and set the secure flag on the cookie and issue a cookies.set(cookie). Since the storeId is still the default store, the cookie leaks to normal mode.

REPRODUCTION STEPS
This is based on http://www.blogs.zeenor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Shared_Dictionary_Compression_over_HTTP.pdf

The SDCH protocol uses unique ID (split into agent id and server id) to identify the compression dictionary.
The agent id is sent from client to server as Avail-Dictionary header:
Avail-Dictionary: GVhc3V48,TWFuIGlz

Server could send unique dictionaries to each client and use those ids to identify client requests similar to tracking cookies.

SDCH logic on the client should probably be changed to follow cookie policy and either don't get or not advertise available dictionary.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

PRIVACY ISSUE
Please provide a brief summary of the privacy issue.
It is unbelievable that to perform such a basic operation as logging out from the Chrome browser - which has become my one and only browser for a few years now - you have to go to a forum and read dozens of pages. Plus, many of the moderators give bogus (and obvious) advice - like ""just disconnect your google account.""
Chrome developers, shake it up! This goes against any principle of transparency, privacy, and security.
Hope we all hear from you.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Go to chrome://plugins, expand Details, and make sure Adobe Flash Player (PPAPI) is disabled.
2. Install the extension from the attachment.
3. Go to youtube.com, and play any video.
4. Inspect the background page of the extension and go to ""Console"".

What is the expected behavior?
The sample extension logs all web requests of the type ""object"". So I would expect to see all requests issued by the Flash video, like it does on Chrome <= 22 or when Flash (PPAPI) is enabled.

What went wrong?
Starting with Chrome 23, requests issued from NPAPI plugins aren't handled by chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest anymore.

333752,Google Chrome WebRTC IP Address Leakage,"Vulnerability Details:
Chrome has a vulnerability whereby internal IP addresses of users can be leaked using Javascript alone without notifying the user.

Affected Versions:
Chrome Version: Version 31.0.1650.63 m + Version 32.0.1700.72 beta-m Stable + Version 34.0.1781.0 Canary
Operating System: Windows 7 Service Pack 1

Reproduction Case:
The following can be executed in the Chrome console to reproduce the test case. A self-contained HTML file has also been attached.

// create a new peer connection - dont need any stun servers for this attack to work
// adding a stun server provides the external ip address of the user as well (see HTML example)
var peer = new webkitRTCPeerConnection(null);

// create an offer object before any streams are added
// this is important because getUserMedia() requires explicit user permission
peer.createOffer(function(sdp) {
peer.setLocalDescription(sdp, function() {
// there seems to be a bug in the async call where the callback is called before the localDescription property has been set
// setTimeout provides some time for the async call to finish
setTimeout(function() {
var sdp = peer.localDescription.sdp;
console.log(sdp);
}, 100);
});
}, function(err) {
console.error(err);
}, {});

Possible Remediation Approach:
One possible approach to resolve this issue is to take the approach used by Mozilla Firefox. Firefox blocks offer creation if no streams have been added to the RTCPeerConnection object. It also does not permit the MediaStream constructors to be called directly and currently it seems that the only way to get a MediaStream is to call getUserMedia(). Currently in the case of Chrome, even if the above fix was used, an empty stream can be added using: peer.addStream(new webkitMediaStream());

Under Chrome OS > Settings > Privacy, the ""Enable Verified Access"" item has a ""Learn more"" link displayed after it. Several of the other items have ""Learn more"" links, too, but those are only displayed in the popup that shows up when clicking the checkbox.

This is inconsistent, and many users will not even discover these hidden ""Learn more"" links because they don't understand the description of a certain checkbox thus never click it.

Or, to put it into a slightly different perspective: Some of the checkboxes will toggle immediately while other checkboxes will show a popup with an explanation -- yet there are no visual cues to the user to discern these two types of checkboxes. Most people don't expect that clicking on a checkbox will do anything but toggling that box, thus many people will never be aware of the availability of the additional information.

By applying a background color to a CSS selector of ""a:visited button"", javascript can determine whether a given URL has been visited or not by evaluating the containing element's height via getClientRects(), at least on OSX.

421691,Accelerometer/gyroscope leak keystrokes and speech,"VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Accelerometer and gyroscope data is provided to websites without permission prompts, yet can be used to monitor keystrokes, and to a limited extent even speech (as well as being used for fingerprinting).

- Monitoring keystrokes of nearby keyboard (fairly high accuracy) [1]:
http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~traynor/papers/traynor-ccs11.pdf

- Monitoring speech (low accuracy) [2]:
https://crypto.stanford.edu/gyrophone/files/gyromic.pdf

- Fingerprinting:
http://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/2013/10/10/stanford-researchers-discover-alarming-method-for-phone-tracking-fingerprinting-through-sensor-flaws/

VERSION
Chrome Version: all
Operating System: any devices with accelerometers and gyroscopes

POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
- Adding permission prompts for Device Motion/Orientation would be overly heavy-handed.

- Instead we could probably prevent such attacks by limiting either the frequency or the number of bits of precision of data returned by the APIs. We don't want to limit them too much of course, as that might prevent good use cases.

- Alternatively, we could detect when the device is stationary, and limit the frequency/precision only whilst the device is stationary. This wouldn't interfere with most legitimate use cases (except earthquake detection), yet would hopefully make such monitoring impractical due to the noise added by the device being in motion.

(I thought there was already a bug for monitoring key strokes, but I couldn't find one)

426026,Infobar reload removal - Indicates the permission for the last gUM request instead of collectively in use permissions,"Version: 40.0.2185.0
OS: All

Background:
The reload infobar was removed in M40 as its not needed to get the audio and video streams anymore after a device change via the omnibox camera bubble.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
0. Clear media permissions, chrome://settings/contentExceptions#media-stream
1. Browse to favorite gUM page, like http://googlechrome.github.io/webrtc/samples/web/content/manual-test/peer2peer/
2. Request Audio and Video
3. Check camera bubble in the omnibox
4. Request Audio only
5. Check camera bubble in the omnibox

What is the expected output?
Camera bubble should indicate the collectively in use permissions.

What do you see instead?
Permissions from the last getUserMedia request.

Step 3 shows camera and microphone in use.
Step 5 shows the microphone in use only but since the video stream is not stopped it's still active hence the camera icon does not reflect the devices in use.

This is not the case in M39, it does shows the microphone and camera for both step 3 and 5.

When Chrome's background mode is enabled ""session only cookies"" do not work as intended. When all the Chrome windows are closed the session cookies should be removed even though background mode is turned on. This does not appear to happen unless Chrome is ran with background mode turned off.

Additionally Chrome's session cookies policy needs to have the ability to accept exceptions. For instance we want to make all cookies to be session cookies but we want to create an exception for Mail.google.com, drive.google.com, and www.google.com/calendar since these cookies are directly related to the storage of offline data for these apps that would be removed otherwise.

This should work by marking mail.google.com,drive.google.com, and www.google/calendar as approved urls and marking * as the session urls. However this doesn't appear to work.

Ideally we would like to be able to enter ! before any entry we added to the session only urls that would signify that it would remain after the session had ended.

See the example below:

Example: !mail.google.com, !drive.google.com, !www.google.com/calendar, *

All URLs except those with the ! would be removed when the session ended. This functionality would be need to be set by the Admin or User depending on the policy settings.

Example URL:

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. visit a domain that has a favicon e.g. domainA.com
2. visit another completely different domain which is a different virtual host on the same physical server e.g. domainB.org

The two domains are not related except they are hosted at the same physical server and they have the same IP.

What is the expected behavior?
when visiting domainA.com, chrome should request domain.com/favicon.ico to show the favicon; when visiting domainB.org, it should request domainB.org/favicon.ico

There is absolutely no reason why it should reuse one domain's favicon for the other unrelated domain. The only thing they have in common from the client's perspective is that they resolve to the same IP.

What went wrong?
after having visited domainA.com, when visiting domainB.org chrome gets the favicon from domainA.com/favicon.ico, hence displaying the incorrect favicon for the site.

I can see the logs at the server and chrome is undubtedly requesting one domain's favicon when visiting the other domain. This is ridiculous. I have already cleared the cache.

The server returns the correct favicon based on the request, it's chrome requesting one domain's favicon though it's visiting the other domain.

Due to my line of work (international exchanges), I have to use my corporate vpn and I don't want anyone to see our original IP to prevent any scans/attacks etc. However, with the latest chrome updates, it is impossible to block webrtc which reveals the real IP address!

The extension option: there is this webrtcblock extension for chrome but it does not work anymore (see ipleak.net). Some people suggest using that scriptsafe extension but it's terrible. If you use that scriptsafe then it blocks all scripts from all sites and you end up ""allow""ing or ""trust""ing all the sites to see their basic content like catpcha modules - this totally negates what the extension was trying to do in the first place. With that extension, I can't even view the developer's own website!

when there is no app installed, this would fire a INSTALL_REFERRER intent with the data ""referrer_string"" and you should be able to see the message somewhere at the bottom after you install the app 

now, with the app installed, click on the link again, it would still open google play instead of the app.

Current incorrect behavior;
Intent with referrer data:
setting: no app installed
1. click on ""Intent with referrer data""
2. directed to google play.
3. install app with referrer data display in app.
4. click on ""Intent without referrer data""
5. still being directed to google play

Expected correct behavior:
setting: no app installed
1. click on ""Intent with referrer data""
2. directed to google play.
3. install app with referrer data display in app.
4. click on ""Intent without referrer data""

What is the expected behavior?
it should try to open the app if it exists, else, fall back to google play store

464985,Incognito windows sometimes have state (if another incognito window was open),"UserAgent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.115 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce the problem:
Every now and then I open an incognito window, try something, close and reopen the incognito window, and realize the state (cookies etc.) from the first try are still there. After the initial confusion, I realize another incognito window was open in the background and kept the state around.

I think this is a security vulnerability so I would like to propose 2 features:

1. When opening a new incognito window, if another incognito window was already open, display a clearly visible message indicating that this is not a fresh incognito window.

2. When closing an incognito window, if another incognito window is still open, bring the other incognito window to the foreground (maybe showing a warning as well) to make it clear that closing the previous incognito window did not destroy the session.

What is the expected behavior?

What went wrong?
Cookies that should have been removed when closing the incognito window, were still around.

479620,Security: Omnibox data privacy leak and MITM vulnerability,"VULNERABILITY DETAILS

The following was verified within the context of Chrome 42.0.2311.90 running in incognito mode using a default user profile.
For the most part, this discussion also applies to other similar browsing contexts. However, slight differences may appear when running in non-incognito mode and/or when changing Chrome settings in either mode.
Fortunately, extensions such as https://www.eff.org/HTTPS-EVERYWHERE can effectively mitigate these vulnerabilities when used.

Problems

1) Omnibox data privacy leak
Many single-word searches from the Omnibox are automatically sent in the clear over the network via DNS resolution request.
An additional background request may again send the single-word search term over the network in the clear if the DNS resolution returns a successful response.

2) MITM vulnerability
An active network attacker can utilize the single-word search vs URL determination behavior to cause an infobar to appear within Chrome that directs the user to an insecure URL.
Requests to the insecure HTTP URL can then be actively attacked in a site spoofing or SSL Stripping like manner.

Discussion

1)
Single word searches are difficult for the Omnibox to disambiguate from single word hostnames as described in https://www.chromium.org/user-experience/omnibox.
However, the current attempt to disambiguate automatically leaks the user's single-word searches in plain text over the network.
For example, type a stock ticker symbol, well-known company brand/name, health related term (pregnancy, STD, etc...), phone number, package tracking number (using hyphens or not; just no whitespace) into the Omnibox and hit enter.
The user will visibly be taken to the Google search results screen. But, quietly in the background an attempt to resolve the single-word to an IP address via DNS is made.
Thus, any passive network attacker can know and gain information about many of the single-word search queries of users on a network.
This is a problem in current versions of Chrome and FireFox.
This privacy leak may have been overlooked since when the search term does not successfully resolve, no further HEAD request is attempted (which would normally show up in a HTTP traffic analyzer tool).
This leak is also not mentioned in the Chrome privacy whitepaper at https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/privacy/whitepaper.html.
If the DNS resolution returns a successful result, then a follow-up HTTP HEAD request is made in order to test the availability of a service at that address.
Neither of these tests can be disabled with user controllable Chrome settings.

2)
In short, active network attackers have a ""browser-approved"" and highly visible way of prompting the user to choose a plausible and insecure alternative browsing decision.
With knowledge of the single-word disambiguation heuristic above, an active (MITM) network attacker can inject successful DNS responses for single-word queries.
Doing this makes Chrome issue a HTTP HEAD request to ""http://single-word-query/"" that the attacker can also intercept and return a successful HTTP response for.
When the HEAD request succeeds, Chrome will display an infobar just under the Omnibox asking if the user if they really meant to go to ""http://single-word-query/"".
If the user then follows the browser's suggestion, she can be compromised by an attacker controlled spoof site at that URL. This could be used as an effective way to subvert SSL Stripping counter-measures, and ultimately lead to obtaining user credentials, etc...
Further compounding this issue is the new gTLD program. For example, ICANN has delegated well-known company names as TLDs now -- ""GOOGLE"" was delegated on September 15, 2014. In the future, it will likely become more commonplace for users to see http://google/ as a valid URL (many users would probably view it as valid even today).
Other plausible, but not yet delegated domains, such as "".corp"" would also be subject to this kind of attack since they are not in the effective TLD ""public suffix list"" yet and thus fall back to this Omnibox search vs URL disambiguation heuristic.

I have attached screenshots of the infobar prompt as well as shots of DNS traffic as seen within WireShark.

479637,"Make ""Location is Allowed"" link reflect Geo Header submission","When a user resets Location for the default search engine, the Default Search Engine UI shows ""Location is Blocked"".

This is misleading when Google is default, because Chrome on Android sends the location via the x-geo header to assist with Omnibox searches. 

We need that UI to reflect this and show ""Location is Allowed"", even though no Location JS permission governs Google Search access to Location.

Same goes for the SingleWebsite details page, it needs to reflect that location is actually being sent. So far, we've been creating individual Location entries so that the user has something to toggle when visiting that page. That works OK for when enabling Location, but is not as good when disabling Location (the user clicking the ""Location is allowed"" link would, if that scheme were in effect, grow an Allowed permission and have to explicitly block it to get the same state they were in before clicking the ""Location is allowed"" link).

The notifications permission carries over to incognito mode, as usual. The website can detect this using the Permissions API or the Push API's permissionState() method. But when the website tries to subscribe, the returned promise will never be resolved (incorrectly mimicing a user ignoring the infobar, but there should be no infobar since the permission was already granted).

3 - Ensure that data entered in localstorage is (i.e. :- Key = test and value = bug is set ) entered correctly by viewing Resource tab > Localstorage 
4 - Go to console tab remove the values by command [ localstorage.clear(); ]
5 - Ensure that data removal is done in localstorage by viewing resource tab > Localstorage
6 - Go to the path of actual storage -(i.e. - C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Local Storage
7- Search the file specific in my case the test.html is running directly from file hence file name is -( __0.localstorage )
8 - Do observe that there are two files. ("" __0.localstorage"" <- Primary file and ""__0.localstorage-journal"" <-backupfile )
9 - Open Both the files in notepad 
10 - You can observe that since clear / removeitem function was executed the data is not present in localstorage but the cleaning of records is not done in journal file. (i.e. the key value test and bug is still seen in journal file, if open via notepad and other transaction details is also visible.)

As per the current method the sqlite DB is set in persist mode which only zeroes on the header but does not remove the data content. Ideally when a clear function or removeitem function is hit it should truncate the entries from the journal database (i.e replacing the roleback journal with zero length for the data content ) however best would be to Delete the journal after successfull execution of the transaction. 

Currently journals are just accumulating transaction done.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
Instructions assumes Javascript is globally enabled already.

Open up an incognito window and browse a target website with that tab ${tab1} (for my example I will use http://www.bing.com as it doesn't redirect to country specific TLDs).

Then open a javascript console of an extension that has access to `chrome.contentSettings` and also with 'Allow in incognito' option set. Preferably with an option page or some kind of persistent page so this window doesn't get killed while testing this.

Run this in the console to block javascript from being blocked

chrome.contentSettings['javascript'].set({
'primaryPattern': '*://www.bing.com/*',
'setting': 'block',
'scope': 'incognito_session_only'
});

What is the expected behavior?
Reloading ${tab1} should reload www.bing.com with javascript disabled.

What went wrong?
Reload ${tab1} and see that the search suggestion still works and the javascript blocked icon is not visible on the address bar.

Now open a new tab ${tab2}, go to 'www.bing.com' and see that no background and the javascript blocked icon is visible. The settings are only applied for new tabs that have not already read the content settings.

Reload both ${tab1} and ${tab2} and see that ${tab1} behaves as expected (as it wasn't changed to begin with) and ${tab2} still has javascript disabled.

Incidentally, running ContentSettings.get to get this info like so

chrome.contentSettings['javascript'].get({
'primaryUrl': 'http://www.bing.com/',
'incognito': true
}, function(settings) {console.info(settings)});

Disabling WebRTC multiple routes was partially successful: my LAN IP address is now hidden on http://ipleak.net/ when it wasn't before, but my unproxied public IP address is still visible.

It appears that WebRTC now uses a single route that bypasses the chosen proxy server.

Did this work before? N/A 

Chrome version: 43.0.2357.81 Channel: stable

Label Cr-Blink-Webrtc-Network should probably be added to this bug, as this is similar to bug 333752 and bug 457492, and they use that label.

This probably shouldn't be merged with either of those bugs since those bugs eventually specifically limit themselves to the solution of allowing someone to disable WebRTC multiple routes, which doesn't work here.

from what I saw, Tor doesn't support UDP. I suspect the leak of the public address is due to the UDP pinging turn/stun. We might need to disable UDP altogether to prevent this leak.

""from what I saw, Tor doesn't support UDP.""

Yes, but totally irrelevant.

When a proxy is specified, it means that all communications must go through the proxy. If the proxy cannot support UDP, UDP should fail; UDP should not try to go around the proxy.

When using a SOCKS proxy, Chromium usually doesn't try to do DNS lookups (via UDP or TCP) or QUIC.

#3 is right. The fact Tor doesn't do UDP is not really related.

Here is what I see. Chrome's parameter ""--proxy-server"" only handles http/https. In my test, Chrome just let udp traffic through when specifying tor as proxy.

If my understanding is correct, the ""leak"" here is caused by not passing UDP through Tor (such that it could either drop it or support it as tcp). The leak could be caused by any UDP based protocol from chrome, not just webrtc. So this needs to be solved at a lower level instead.

QUIC will fall back to SYPD if proxy is detected, hence avoiding the ip leak issue there. It seems that we should do similar - i.e. if proxy is specified AND the multiple_routes is disabled, only http route will be used.

Here is the design I'm leaning toward to.

The assumption I'm making here is that Tor users will have proxy configured manually (instead of using PAC or auto-detected). If we detect that's the case AND another to-be-invented property set (similar to multiple_routes), we'll stop UDP altogether.

Could anyone comment whether this will or not work for your scenario?
Comment 13 by erle...@gmail.com on Fri, Jul 10, 2015, 8:02 PM GMT+10

more_vert
I think that assuming manual proxy configuration would be incorrect. A scenario where PAC makes sense includes:

* Initial setup of multiple browsers to not leak IP addresses when using proxies
* Desire to connect to only some websites using proxy
* Desire to avoid using proxy with any other websites
* The websites you want to proxy might change in the future

For example, you want dozens of your employees to be able to conduct research on competitors through Tor. You don't want to burden the Tor network with your employees' Facebook browsing and YouTube watching. Competitors might come and go, so you need a way to update the list of hostnames to dozens of computers. IP address leaks are a bad thing.

For a non-Tor example, you want your VPN service to be able to offer your customers access to geographically-restricted videos. You don't want to burden your network with people playing WoW or downloading downloading ISOs. Restrictive video sites might come and go or change CDN hostnames, so you need a way to easily update the list of hostnames on every browser on a user's computer. IP address leaks are a bad thing.

If I read your comment correctly, I think you're making a case that PAC has some use cases that manual configuration won't achieve. I totally agree with that. However, what I'm not getting is how this fits into the picture of webrtc, particularly in the context of stopping IP leak. The proposal I had in #12 doesn't change how other traffic works. It only changes webrtc's traffic.

Are you saying that you have scenarios where PAC is used and you still want WebRTC's traffic to go through the proxy from PAC? PAC could be configured in a way that TURN gets a proxy A, STUN gets proxy B, remote candidate 1 gets proxy C, candidate #2 gets proxy D.. etc. Even if we could implement this, I have a hard time to imagine how people will validate the proxy selection.

Maybe I have misunderstood your point. Could you clarify?

Another question I have. 

Would you rather to have 

1) a check box ""Honor my proxy"" which, when manually checked, stops UDP and uses any kind of proxy setting in chrome, 

2) or a default which will only honor the proxy if the proxy is manually configured (i.e. UDP will still be used if proxy is configured through PAC nor auto detect). Note that the manually configured proxy might not always be the routable path to TURN though.

I misread comment 15, and I found another example of PAC file usage, so I'll try again.

Comment 14:

Yes, there are some cases where you want WebRTC's traffic to go through the proxy from PAC. Here are two examples.

On jailbroken iOS, you can't set a system-wide SOCKS proxy using the iOS settings. One workaround is to use a PAC file (see http://www.systutorials.com/4876/how-to-configure-ios-for-iphone-and-ipad-to-use-socks-proxy-created-by-ssh/) to specify one proxy for all traffic.

With Internet Explorer's proxy settings (which are used as system proxy settings by Firefox and Chrome quite frequently, and so are used to configure all browsers in one place), SOCKS4a and SOCKS5 proxies can't be entered (it only allows for SOCKS4). The workaround is to use PAC files (see https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=245247#c10).

---

Comment 15:

I'd prefer the first option.

Most importantly, if I know what I'm doing and I use a PAC file, the second option denies me the ability to stop WebRTC's UDP usage, since the second option doesn't do it and there's no way to shut off WebRTC except on Android.

Also, the second option will defeat the obvious expectations of users and system administrators, and it will do so when security is on the line. People will expect, if they specify in a PAC file that all traffic is carried over one proxy, that this won't allow traffic to leak outside of the proxy.

#1 seems like the simplest short-term solution. 

We may need to eventually have some extension for the PAC file that indicates when WebRTC traffic should traverse the proxy, or perhaps just follow the decision made for the HTTP origin.

I would also consider #1 to be a good enough solution, just let us decide whenever we persist to honoring our proxy settings. 

45.0.2454.37 is still leaking the public IP and thus rending using a socks proxy for privacy reasons totally useless. I am truly surprised that it takes this long to implement a fix.

It has been argued that this is not actually a security problem and is by design, and was resolved by the ""multiple_routes_enabled"" preference [1]. However, a user should be able to decide if he wants to allow WebRTC, regardless of whether there is a known security/privacy hole, and there is currently no way to disable it (except on Android in chrome://flags).

The argument in the previous discussion was that a question of ""do you want to allow this site to use WebRTC?"" would be confusing to most users, which I have to agree with. Yet other users (including me) want to have this freedom, and it seems to be bad PR to not give it to them. A simple solution is possible: add a choice to chrome://settings/content similar to the following:

1. allow WebRTC for all sites (default)
2. always ask
3. never allow

This is standard practice for a lot of Chrome's features, even very basic ones - JavaScript, pop-ups, even images. The political decision of whether to make #2 default can be kept for later.

Another possibility is to enable the ""disableWebRTC"" option in chrome://flags for other platforms than just Android, but this would solve the problem only partially - i.e. I want to be able to explicitly allow WebRTC when I actually want to use it.

I've deleted every item matching ""Google"" from the cookies and site data window and I believe I've confirmed the 14MB is gone since I cannot find it anywhere in the Canary system folder, but I have doubts since I still am unable to navigate to mail.google.com.

Every other Google service works fine. Even Inbox. It is only mail.google.com, and it's surely because of this spooky database that cannot go away.

532394,Enable SAML SSO auth for Chrome apps,"go/saml-webview

Some of our most used apps on Chromebooks e.g. Citrix Receiver, VPN apps, etc, open a <webview> to run authentication (and other) flows within their own apps. The same customers who use these enterprise apps also login to their Chromebooks using an SSO provider which produces SAML cookies which are then pushed into Chromes cookie jar for their profile. These cookies can later identify users across various different Web services accessed through the browser.

<webview>s however are by design isolated Web instances that do not get access to Chromes cookie jar. This means that users need to login twice to access their favorite apps, once to the Chromebook itself and yet another time to their apps (e.g. Citrix).

Ensuring that apps have a way to authenticate the user using his/her existing SAML tokens can eliminate an extra login step and greatly enhance the experience for users on that flow.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Please see the following link for instructions on filing security bugs:
http://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/reporting-security-bugs


VULNERABILITY DETAILS
I wrote a PoC for reliably sniffing browser history in Chrome/Firefox by observing which domains have associated HSTS entries. I showed it to Chris Palmer, who suggested I file it here :). The code is pretty well-commented but basically it works like this:
1. User visits attacker page
2. Browser attempts to load images from various HSTS domains over HTTP
3. Attacker has set a CSP policy that restricts images to HTTP, so image sources are blocked before they are redirected to HTTPS. This is crucial; if the browser completes a request to the HTTPS site, then it will receive the HSTS pin, and the attack will no longer work when the user visits the page again.
4. When an image gets blocked by CSP, its onerror handler is called. In this case, the onerror handler does some tricks to time how long it took for the image to be redirected from HTTP to HTTPS. If this time is on the order of a millisecond, it was an HSTS redirect (no network request was made), which means the user has visited the image's domain before. If it's on the order of 100 milliseconds, then a network request probably occurred, meaning that the user hasn't visited the image's domain.

This also works in incognito mode (can see which hosts the user has visited in their non-incognito session) and chrome on android. I haven't tried other platforms.

There is the possibility of user data leaking between subsequent users of a Public Session if the previous user forgot to log out. To a certain extent, this could be mitigated by mandating a reasonable DeviceIdleLogoutTimeout (eg. 5 minutes).

Since the product had been released without mandatory DeviceIdleLogoutTimeout and by now there are users who depend on it, it is probably too late to change that stance.

- Someone hardcoded extension notification updates to be allowed.
- The Chrome extension update notification was sent from www.google.com instead of being generated locally by Chrome (I really hope not?) due to the corp-override to allow notifications for that site (screenshot).

595532,Replace icons with overflow menu in Manage Certificates,"tl;dr 
We're replacing the line of icons with an overflow icon, and including each action within the menu. 

From our email thread: 

In current mocks, each certificate entry is associated with a dedicated list of icons (view, edit, export, import, delete, see attachments). This results in too many icons on the page, and it takes too long to render (3-4 seconds on my machine). The problem is mostly present on the ""Authorities"" tab, because that is the certificate category with the most entries.

Note that in the old Options UI, there is a single set of buttons at the bottom, and the list items do not have any dedicated icons. The button set corresponds to the certificate that is selected at a given time (see old_ca_certificates_list attachment).

Also another thing to note (which I have mentioned in the folio comments a few weeks ago), is that the ""import"" icon makes little sense to be per-entry, since it simply imports a new certificate, has nothing to do with the row on which it is displayed.

Should there be any changes to the current mocks? Specifically
1) What should we do with the current ""import"" icon?
2) Per-entry icons vs single icon-set?
Solution1: Have single set of icons (similar to the buttons in the old Options UI).
Solution2: Create a ""dots"" popup menu per-entry similar to search engine entries and move (view, edit, export, delete) options there.
Solution3: Lazily render the icons for an entry, only when the parent certificate authority is expanded. I tried this and it does improve performance, with the caveat that expanding the certificate authority snaps to its full height instead of animating to it.

Some non-session cookies appear to turn into zombie-cookies, through an unknown mechanism. These cookies do not appear in the ""Cookies and site data"" UI. Additionally, clicking ""Remove all"" in that dialog does not delete them. Chromium continues to send them in request headers, even though the user cannot see that they exist without manually examining the Cookies sqlite database (or examining the headers Chromium sends).


VERSION:
Chrome Version: 49.0.2623.108 + stable
Operating System: Built on Ubuntu 14.04, running on LinuxMint 17 (64-bit)


REPRODUCTION STEPS
1. Create a fresh user-data directory, and start Chromium pointing at that directory (using --user-data-dir)
2. Navigate to https://www.eff.org/files/Changelog.txt (and note that this page does not set cookies)
3. Open up the developer tools, and set a cookie via Javascript via the console (say document.cookie=""COOKIE=1; expires=Sat, 31 Dec 2016 12:00:00 UTC"")
4. Navigate to chrome://settings/search#cookie and click on ""Content Settings"", then ""All cookies and site data""
5. Verify the cookie has been set, then close the browser
6. Start Chromium again, again pointing to the same user-data directory (using --user-data-dir)
7. Navigate to chrome://settings/search#cookie and click on ""Content Settings"", then ""All cookies and site data""
8. Verify the cookie for www.eff.org is not listed, even though it hasn't expired and was not a session cookie.
9. In that same tab, open up developer tools, and choose ""Network""
10. In that same tab, navigate to https://www.eff.org/files/Changelog.txt and examine the request headers sent by Chromium
11. The cookie appears to be sent, even though it was not listed in the UI. (If it is not sent, try refreshing the page. There appears to be some sort of non-determinancy where sometimes the cookie is sent, and sometimes it isn't.)
12. Go back to chrome://settings/search#cookie and click on ""Content Settings"", then ""All cookies and site data""
13. Click ""Remove all""
14. If you navigate once again to https://www.eff.org/files/Changelog.txt you will see the cookie is still being sent
15. Close the browser
16. Examine the cookies table contained in the sqlite database user_data_dir/Default/Cookies
17. You will see that the cookie is still in the database, even though we supposedly removed all cookies


ADDITIONAL NOTES
* Not all cookies turn into zombie-cookies, for some reason.
* This is not specific to cookies set via javascript. Cookies set via reply headers also sometimes demonstrate this behavior.
* These zombie-cookies *do* disappear from the Cookies DB and are no longer sent when they expire
* These zombie-cookies *are* successfully deleted by instead using the ""Clear browsing data"" UI path, which makes me think this bug has something to do with Issue 136498

1. Type a specific string in an incognito window frequently (e.g. an acronym in a url)
2. Observe that when typing similar strings outside of Chrome (e.g. in hangouts) the string from the incognito window is suggested as a correction.

What is the expected behavior?
Any information typed in incognito mode should not go into the keyboard's dictionary or suggestion model

What went wrong?
The sensitive content typed in incognito windows was suggested outside of incognito window context. This shows that the information is available outside of incognito mode, and opens the potential for a user to accidentally leak something they'd like to be private.

(2) Send print job(s) to cloudprint printer. Jobs should print as expected.
(3) Observe files in user's %TEMP% folder (C:\Users\jayhlee\AppData\Local\Temp\2

One customer now has over 65k files in their temp folder since Chrome is not cleaning this up. This broke printing as Chrome can't write temp files any longer due to filesystem limitations. Filling up the hard drive is also a possibility.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Open a URL with a valid Public-Key-Pins header (I tested with https://cyph.im and https://github.com).

2. Confirm the browser's success of processing the header via chrome://net-internals/#hsts > ""Query domain"".

3. Open chrome://settings/clearBrowserData clear any arbitrary subset of items (e.g. just ""Passwords"", doesn't matter).

4. Re-run the query at chrome://net-internals/#hsts.

What is the expected behavior?
There should be no change from the output of step #2.

What went wrong?
Pinned key hashes (and more broadly, all records prefixed with ""dynamic_"") no longer exist.

May not necessarily be considered a hair-on-fire bug given the user action required to trigger it, but it almost entirely destroys the benefit of HPKP for users like myself who find themselves frequently wiping the browser cache for development/testing/debugging purposes, and it could very easily be leveraged against a user via social engineering as part of a larger targeted attack.

What do you see instead?
It keeps counting like if clearing browsing data step was not done.

This happen for 2 reasons:
a) First reason is that StoragePartitionImpl::ClearDataImpl is called for the non-incognito DOMStorageContext only.
b)Second reason reason is that StoragePartitionImpl::ClearSessionStorageOnUIThread has no effect unless there is a backing on the disk (which is never the case in private browsing mode)

The same behavior can be reproduced in non-incognito mode when commenting the call to GetDOMStorageContext()->SetSaveSessionStorageOnDisk() from ProfileImpl::DoFinalInit().

In our embedded case we actually would like to force clearing Session Storage in non-incognito mode when it is not backed on disk. Also we would like to force clearing both Local Storage and Session Storage in incognito mode. In these 3 cases, by clearing I mean erasing the runtime cache (no backing on disk in these cases)
In our embedded web view, we do not hit a) since we do not use that UI.

615851,Security: Timing attack on denormalized floating point arithmetic in SVG filters circumvents same-origin policy,"VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Arithmetic with denormalized floating point values results in characteristic timing behavior. Multiple SVG filters perform calculation between pixel values and floating point parameters. If the provided parameters are denormalized, execution time is measurably faster if pixel values of zero are multiplied with the denormalized parameter, compared to multiplication of a pixel value larger than zero. This allows an attacker to construct a timing channel to read pixels from images and iframes containing content from other sources, by measuring the timing difference between operations on black and nonblack pixels. Other filters can be used to change any specific color or color range to black, so any information or color can be read from other pages.

Based on their definitions, I believe the following filters to be vulnerable:
feColorMatrix
feComponentTransfer
feComposite
feConvolveMatrix
feDisplacementMap

Timing channels using SVG filters have been discovered before. Other than vulnerabilities described in http://www.contextis.com/documents/2/Browser_Timing_Attacks.pdf, this attack isn't based on control flow through execution paths of different length, but it is based on specific values which CPUs handle differently.

A similar attack has been described in ""On Subnormal Floating Point and Abnormal Timing"", but the researchers believed Chrome wasn't vulnerable to this attack. My exploit demonstrates that it actually is.

To fix this vulnerability, simply make sure calculation isn't applied on denormalized values. This should not cause any practical issues because denormalized numbers really aren't required for filters operations, so they can safely be rounded to zero.

Operating System: Windows 8.1, no service pack

REPRODUCTION CASE
An exploit is attached which demonstrates the vulnerability. It reconstructs an external image of 10 by 10 pixels, which is easy to visually verify for faults. Reconstruction on my test machine results in about 0-2 faulty reads, and takes about 10 seconds for 100 pixels, this could be made at least twice as fast at the cost of some accuracy. Using the technique described in the Context paper to read characters, this means at least 2-4 characters per second can be read. This exploit is based on feConvolveMatrix, as it is very easy with this filter to perform many arithmetic operations. However, I think any of the above listed filters can be used to construct an exploit like this.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

PRIVACY ISSUE
Chrome allows HTTP Authentication username and passwords to be supplied in the URI. For example, http://username:password@example.com. If the server accepts these credentials (or ignores them), then the page will load and the URI will be displayed in the address bar as example.com, without the credentials.

When a user goes to print that page, if the ""Headers and Footers"" option is checked, the full URI, including credentials, is printed in the footer.

Note: This appears to only happen when the credentials are supplied in the URI. A user who uses the browser to input the credentials after a 401 will not see the credentials when printing.

This could allow user's to leak credentials without realizing it. This is especially true if a user clicks a link and doesn't realize credentials are present in the URI at all.

619429,Able to bypass permission prompt on keypress,"VULNERABILITY DETAILS
It is possible for a web page to automatically request and accept webcam access with a single keystroke of Space Bar (without the permission prompt being visible). The webcam recording UI (red dot on tab) is shown as normal.

I believe this is done by simply requesting webcam access in a ""keydown"" event listener. The keypress that activates the request also automatically presses the Accept button (which is focused by default). I haven't looked at the details. Making Deny the default would fix the security problem, but still be a UI issue as it would mean a legitimate attempt to start recording when you tap space bar would fail mysteriously.

625888,Disable All Extensions On Certain Domain Names/Sites,"PRIVACY ISSUE
Currently, If an installed extension has <all_urls>, http://*?* and https://*/* permissions, it can run on all of the web pages. These permissions enable extensions to be more useful. But, on the other hand, a malicious extension can track user's activities, and log private and financial data.

I've noticed that extensions are not allowed on Chrome Web Store web pages. Chrome team could expand this for other websites, where users can ""whitelist"" certain websites on which no extension is allowed to execute its content scripts even if has <all_urls> permission.

I understand that there is incognito mode where extensions are disabled by default, but still, such an option would be better.

This vulnerability is about bypassing the fix to CVE-2016-1617 (Issue 544765, see https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=544765). The fix proposed in that bug was to make ""img-src http:"" === ""img-src http: https:"" (See comment 19 in that bug).

But there is a flaw in this fix: ""img-src http://example.com:80"" is not equivalent to ""img-src http://example.com:80 https://example.com:443""; rather, it allows http://example.com/ while blocks https://example.com/. So by simply modifying the CSP header, the trick (using HSTS or 301 redirect) works again.

Note that you must list the domain names explicitly in the CSP (i.e. ""img-src http://*:80"" doesn't block https://example.com:443).

This bug is also reproducible in latest stable version of Firefox.

Sometimes a website gets into trouble and I need to remove cookies for that particular website. I don't want to remove cookies for all websites, and I don't want to search for it manually in a looooong long list. Old Settings allows me to do that - easily search for the appropriate cookies by typing (part of) the domain, and then select them all and remove in one swift action. 
In the new UI I have to manually search for all related cookies and click on every single one of them to remove it - so if the website creates a lot of them, that's a lot of completely unnecessary and annoying clicking. You should make it possible to delete all the cookies that the user can filter for.

As a side note, quite honestly I'm not even sure what's the point of messing around with the current settings UI. It's totally fine as-it-is, good old ""it's not broken so don't try and 'fix' it"" comes to mind.

What is the expected behavior?
Recent bookmarks should exclude page visits that occurred in incognito mode.

If possible, it should exclude bookmarks that were created from an incognito window.

Obviously, the fact that a page is bookmarked cannot be discarded upon exiting incognito mode, but ""This page was visited at this time"" seems as close to browsing history as you can get. This gives the user the impression that bookmarking a page exempts it from the promise Chrome makes when you open an incognito window, which is confusing.

What went wrong?
The ""Recent bookmarks"" section in the new tab page shows bookmarked pages that were visited in incognito (and when!).

This means that we show the correct value if the user chooses to delete ""everything"", but only a partial value if they choose a finite time range, such as ""past hour"".

This is because adding a time-range-based counting mechanism to the cache backend was not supported as it could potentially take a long time.

However, the counter can still be improved. We could run another calculation task in parallel, this time using the public cache interface (i.e. the iterator) to calculate the size of items in the given range. In cases where the cache is small and the parallel calculation finishes quickly enough, we will be able to show the precise value.

To debug these situations, it'd be handy to be able to see which extensions are currently holding locks.

Right now, it just includes ""extension"" in the list if chrome.power is being used, but maybe we could also list the IDs of all extensions using the API.

I'm not sure if there are PII concerns around logging extension IDs in powerd's log file. It's readable by any user on the system, so one user could look at it to see which extensions another user has installed.

I'm hoping someone can double check this for me, but I have been able to replicate the issue on both my Nexus 6 and LG V20 (both running Android 7.0):

Steps to repro:
1) Open an incognito tab in Google Chrome
2) Enable dual-window/multi-window
3) Open a second incognito tab in Google Chrome
4) Move one of the incognito tabs to the other window
5) Optional: sign into an account on any website (such as your gmail account)
6) Close both incognito windows
7) Optional: disable dual-window/multi-window
8) Open another incognito tab and go to your account from step 5 - your previously signed in account will still be signed in.

Observed behavior:
Even after all incognito windows are closed manually, the notification to close incognito tabs remains active and tapping it appears to have no effect. The only way I have found to remove it is to completely restart the phone.

Furthermore, it seems that cookies and other data from the incognito windows remain present until the phone is restarted (or if the issue is fixed any other way).

What is the expected behavior?
Chrome should display an icon noting that content is blocked, with the ability to create an exception like the desktop browser. This will only ever be displayed if a user has disabled content in site settings, so it won't waste any UI space for most users. It should probably be a single icon expanding to a menu for all of the site settings, unlike the desktop. Maybe not on the tablet UI, but the phone UI doesn't have much space to spare.

This would be far more useful on Android than it is on the desktop too, since extensions aren't available as an alternative. It makes the built-in site settings features more important.

* Synchronous APIs restrict the options for getting user permission before performing an action. Some permission models (like the Permissions API) require an async API.

OS Version: 10.0

TL;DR: restricting externall_connectable to third level domain wildcards effectively (though indirectly) decreases chrome security.

There are a class of extensions that need to interact with arbitrary websites, but only if the website in question is cooperative. A great example of this are security related extensions that simplify 2FA via browser extensions. Such extensions serve no purpose when interacting with a page that doesn't integrate with the extension, but any page can integrate with the extension and the list of all pages that integrate is dynamic and not available at install time.

At the moment, for such an extension to do its job it needs to inject a content script which effectively gives the extension full control over all websites the user browses, not just the ones that integrate with the extension. This situation is less than ideal because now instead of having to trust the website they are viewing with the data provided to the website, the user must trust the extension with all information they enter into any chrome tab.

This is a *massive* security escalation but it is required because `https://*` isn't available to the `externally_connectable` permission. The security impact of a compromised extension that requires content_scripts to `https://*` is effectively a complete browser compromise. The security impact of a compromised extension that requires externally_connectable to `https://*` however is restricted to the data that is sent by any webpage to the extension.

By restricting externally_connectable to third level domain wildcards and below, the permissions API has effectively lowered security instead of raising it because it leaves only the worse of two options to extensions that need to interact with a dynamic set of webpages and further trains users away from being cautious of extensions that ask for wildcard content_scripts.

Here is an example of an extension that would benefit from such permissions (to the point where a back-door hack was added just for this extension): https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=417062 Non-Google developed chrome extensions that need this are ones that add support for external hardware to chrome (e.g., external security hardware) or interact with desktop apps/drivers.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

686253,Security: Cross-origin pixel reading and history sniffing via SVG filter timing attack,"VULNERABILITY DETAILS
By rendering a FeConvolveMatrix SVG filter over a target iframe and timing its execution an attacking page can extract pixel values from a cross-origin page being iframe'd.

This also allows reading ones own origin for history sniffing.

This is based on previous work we did, see http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dkohlbre/papers/subnormal.pdf

VERSION
Chrome Version: at least 54 to 57.02987.8
Operating System: Ubuntu Linux 16.10, Windows 10, OSX 10.11.6, ChromeOS 55.0.2883.105.

REPRODUCTION CASE
I've attached a PoC that reconstructs a 48x48 px region from the chosen origin into a canvas.
It works very well on static pages, and will work intermittently on active pages.

Up the pixel multiplier if it doesn't seem to be working on your machine. (100-500 are reasonable ranges, and it depends on your build and env what works best)

screenshot of a successful run is also attached.

NOTES
This must be run on a Chrome platform that supports GPU acceleration of SVG filters. (Ex: Mac mini isn't vulnerable)
The attack does not run on the GPU, but takes advantage of the FTZ and DAZ FPU flags being disabled if the element being rendered is already texture backed.

This bug will be included in a USENIX Security conference submission (2/16/17) but will not be published for at least several months after that.

DETAILS
Normally it appears that Skia sets the FPU DAZ and FTZ flags when executing SVG filters on the CPU. However, if the element being rendered is already in the GPU pipeline (forced with transform:rotateY(1deg)) then these flags are not set. We are taking advantage of floating point multiply timing differences on the CPU, which we get back to via making a kernel of size >36. see https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/skia/src/effects/SkMatrixConvolutionImageFilter.cpp?l=304

We are using timing differences in floating point multiplies between 0*subnormal and 2.x*subnormal. See https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/skia/src/effects/SkMatrixConvolutionImageFilter.cpp?l=186 etc.

It is highly likely that other SVG filters are impacted by this bug in the same way. As long as you can cause a bail from the GPU so that the FTZ and DAZ flags aren't set any multiply with secret data is vulnerable. Division is vulnerable even with FTZ and DAZ.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
687834,Camera permissions not working as intended?,"Chrome Version: (56.0.2924.76 (Official Build) (64-bit)
OS: OSX

What steps will reproduce the problem?
(1) Go to any site that accesses the camera (eg: https://qix.github.io/webcam-slitscan/)
(2) Pick ""Allow"" when asked for camera pemission
(3) Close the tab
(4) Go to the site again

What is the expected result?

Chrome should ask the user for permission to use te camera


What happens instead?


Chrome doesn't ask and the camera is used automatically


Going into settings the options are

1. Ask when a site requires access to your camera
2. Do not allow sites to access your camera

It does NOT say

1. Ask and forever give permission to access your camera from this site.

I want it to do what it says in settings which is to ask ""Ask when a site requires access to your camera"" not ask only the first time. Otherwise a site asks once, say for a simple demo, now that site can turn on my camera from every page on that site at anytime. That's a huge privacy issue. It happened to me to today. I visited a site I had not visited in years, it started using my camera WITHOUT ASKING FOR PERMISSION. I had no warning and no opportunity to say no. I was not in a presentable state.

Sure it makes sense for hangouts because hangouts is trustworthy. I know it won't turn my camera on unless I initiate a video hangout but the rest of the internet is not that trustworthy, not asking for permission each time seems like a really bad idea.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Go to https://brainwashing.secur3.us/test.pdf in Chrome
2. Observe that this document triggers a web request without asking permission.

Alternatively, follow instructions to generate a canary PDF document from http://canarytokens.org/generate and load the file with Chrome

What is the expected behavior?
Chrome/pdfium should be prompting before making an external web request to prevent inadvertent privacy exposure.

Adobe's PDF products for example has a permissions request. OS X Preview tool simply ignores the external resource referenced in the document.

What went wrong?
By opening this PDF document in Chrome, the use is redirected without prompt to an arbitrary HTTP server. This is undesirable as it is a privacy exposure revealing the IP address and user-agent that opened the PDF.

695474,Broken prefetch links can exfiltrate adjacent page text,"Modified bug report based on the attachment provided by the reporter:

Should a web page suffer from an XSS or HTML injection vulnerability an attack might inject a broken pre-fetch link, as follows:
<link rel=prefetch href=http://

The payload above leaves Google Chrome to decide how the rest of the link should be treated. Currently (tested on version 53.0.2 64bit) Google uses adjacent page contents to complete the anchor (href). This can be seen in First.png.
<See First.png>

The broken pre-fetch link triggers a DNS lookup using the page contents as a domain name.

Given that DNS is often deployed unencrypted, with no authentication and can be easily eavesdropped on; this means any DNS queries that result from injection of broken pre-fetch links can be used to expose sensitive page contents such as an input field containing a password.

Visiting bookmarked pages in incognito leaves a trace in favicon cache

Related old bug: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22670

VERSION:
Chrome Version: 10+ (stable)
Operating System: all

REPRODUCTION STEPS
1. Clear browsing history.
2. Visit a page like www.google.com.
3. Bookmark the page (might need to be fast, before the page has finished loading).
4. Open bookmarks UI (favicon is missing).
5. Open incognito tab.
6. Visit the bookmark.
7. Close incognito tab.
8. Open bookmarks UI.

Expected: favicon is missing (i.e. the incognito visit left no trace).
Actual: favicon is available (i.e. non-gray nice icon displayed).

Steps 1..4 and 8 could be exploited intentionally by a user that shares a device with another user, to know if the latter visits a certain page in incognito.

NOTE: besides the privacy aspect of this, let me mention that changing the logic to *not* update the favicon cache could cause a regression for users that regularly visit bookmarked pages in incognito, since the icon itself would never be updated.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0

OS: Windows(7,8,10).

Steps to reproduce:
1.Launch Chrome, go to chrome://md-settings, change browser language to 'French' from chrome://md-settings/languages.
2.Relaunch chrome, go to chrome://md-settings/appearance, change font size to 'Very Large'.
3.Go to chrome://md-settings/privacy and security, scroll down and click on Clear browsing data, observe the overlay.

OS: Android 7.1.1

What steps will reproduce the problem?
(1) Search Google in Chrome Canary. Might need to be a location-sensitive search.

What is the expected result?
The prompt makes sense.

What happens instead?
""Chrome needs permissions access to share them with this site."" (needs-permissions-infobar.png)

1) That sentence has poor grammar.
2) The sentence doesn't communicate that the site already has a permission granted. This is exposed in Page Info (page-info-search-engine-geolocation-disclosure.png), but it's extra confusing for the special case where the default search engine is granted geolocation.
3) It's unclear what permissions are affected. The plural word ""permissions"" implies multiple permissions, even if in this case it's just one.
4) ""Update permissions"" is a blue action button. This is *exactly* the same styling we use for the ""Allow"" button in a permission prompt (mic-prompt.png). Although there is a secondary modal prompt from the OS (os-prompt.png). If I didn't already know a lot about the Android and Chrome permission models, I'd be scared to press that button. (In this case, also consider that Google has a reputation for trying to siphon up all your data.)

Note that this example uses the search engine geolocation case because that's how I triggered it. However, we should make sure to address this if it can ever happen for other permissions.

I think this prompt falls way below Enamel's standards of clarity. Could we try to address it soon?

Steps to reproduce the problem:
Id like to bring to your attention the fact that the feature allowing websites to access the light level reported by a device using either the old-style devicelight event or the new Ambient Light Sensor API allows information leaks across origins. Specifically, it allows the detection of the screen color which leads pixel-perfect attacks (similar to https://www.contextis.com/documents/2/Browser_Timing_Attacks.pdf but without the timing vector).

Specifically an attacker can steal the contents of cross-origin images or frames and detect the color of links, allowing her to determine if a link has been visited by the user or not. The attack is not affected by the precision of the light sensor readout (at least as long as there is sufficient precision to distinguish a white vs. black screen) or the supported readout frequency. Chrome currently supports the AmbientLightSensor and devicelight APIs under the Generic Sensor and Experimental Web Platform Features flags respectively.

The issue is described and demonstrated here: https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/stealing-sensitive-browser-data-with-the-w3c-ambient-light-sensor-api/

What is the expected behavior?

What went wrong?
tl;dr Please consider requiring browser permissions for access to light sensor readings.

Platform: 9334.52.0 (Official Build) beta-channel chell

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Deploy root CA to Chrome via policy
2. Do not use proxy or SSL inspection
3. Multiple sign-in disabled; all future sites show Enterprise logo

What is the expected behavior?
SSL inspection and Certificate management should be treated as two different concepts that are being linked together as one.

What went wrong?
In enterprise, there are several reasons to deploy SSL certificates (some examples):

1) To allow Chromebook to trust/validate the identity of remote hosts using non-universal CAs.

2) To allow Chromebook to validate its own identity as a form of authentication to a network or application (client certs)

3) In order to intercept traffic, or route all traffic through a proxy for SSL inspection/sniffing.

Many customers may want to perform all of the above, though some only want to perform the first two. By deploying a single root CA for the sole purpose of trusting internal PKI, Chrome Policy thinks that I am attempting to SSL inspect and takes the following unintended actions:
- Multiple sign-in is disabled. Documentation states that SSL inspection disables multiple sign-in, which makes sense since (but I'm not SSL-inspecting and Chrome should know this)
- All future https websites visited by the user show the Enterprise logo instead of the Lock logo, which implies that Enterprise is sniffing this traffic, even though our root CAs do not and cannot, leading to user confusion and frustration (""are you snooping my Facebook or Bank traffic? I see the Enterprise logo"")

The recommendation/bug/FR is to treat certificates more similar to other major OS and separate SSL inspection from Certificate management in any of the following ways: 
- have a clear way to indicate ""This Root CA is used to perform SSL inspection"" 
- only activate SSL inspection when a proxy is used.
- allow per-domain policy for root CAs (""only apply this root CA to the following domains"")
- per-CA checkbox to differentiate between SSL inspection and security/client identification certificate

Permission-requiring features are currently disabled while in VR (both in the browser and WebVR) because the permission UIs are not yet supported. (Issue 736568 contains references to many of these.)

If the user has already granted permission to an origin and the page has started using the feature, the page can continue to use the feature when inserted into the headset (the VR browser displays an indicator for some features).

However, if the page does not start using the feature, for which the origin has permission, before the user enters VR (including upon navigation within VR), the page is not allowed to use the feature.

Given that we allow the features at all, it's not clear why they aren't always allowed when a permission has already been granted. Such inconsistency seems likely to confuse users even more than the fact that permissions must be granted beforehand.

We should always allow features for which the origin has already been granted permission. While there may be corner cases, such as the user has revoked an Android permission from Chrome, that is an unlikely corner case.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

What's presumably going on:
When a page URL includes a fragment (aka ref, e.g. #foo) HistoryBackend::SetFaviconMappingsForPageAndRedirects() associates it to the full URL as well as the stripped version which doesn't have a fragment. This is useful as documented in the CL that introduced the logic, https://codereview.chromium.org/1180403005 and the associated bug, where multiple sample sites are provided.

This however assumes the URL without the fragment exists in history. If not, an orphan favicon will be stored in the database (i.e. no corresponding history entry exists), and it will never be deleted (except for full history deletion).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

766973,"canMakePayment allows information leaks/fingerprinting, invisible to the user","Steps to reproduce the problem:
Hi,

Chrome canMakePayment has a number of interesting properties:

- fingerprinting (enumerating payment methods such as whether one has a visa/mastercard/diner/etc saved in the browser)
- there is no UI prompt when a payment 'match' is found so it can be made invisibly to the user

A demonstration here:
https://lukaszolejnik.com/stuff/cmp.html

Requires having a cc added, and not being in incognito mode (which means it may also be a new method of detecting incognito).

Tested on Chrome Canary, desktop/android.

What is the expected behavior?
1. There should be a prompt, at least as per https://w3c.github.io/payment-request/#exposing-available-payment-methods ""a successful match to a payment method causes a user interface to be displayed mitigates the disclosure risk""

What went wrong?
No UI display, and a site learned I included visa and/or mastercard.

Additionally, in incognito mode a site knew I had all CCs included. This is made possible by the fact that canMakeRequest should be able to only query a single card (i.e. ""visa"") once per quota-permitted timing (30m in Chrome). So I know that the same origin testing visa and mastercard consecutively would eventually reach an exception. No exception is raised.

1. Time displayed is just keep increasing (for me, it shows 50 hours something).
2. This information is synced with incognito as well as other build in same PC (Dev, Canary, etc).

I'm guessing that this is some OS level information because of 2nd observation. This might be useful for tracking same user who uses incognito and normal mode. This information can be obtained by website. You can type ""document.querySelectorAll(""video"")[1].played.end(0)"" on console.

An attacker can determine whether a link is visited or not by observing if
a `paint` method call has been invoked.

In the attached attack, we set a custom painter from a CSS Paint API worklet as
the background of a link element. If we use the DOM to switch the link's href
from a visited URL to an unvisited URL (or vice versa), the `paint` method of
the custom painter is invoked. On the other hand, if we switch it from one
unvisited URL to another unvisited URL (or visited to visited), the `paint`
method is not invoked. We can observe the presence or absence of this extra
`paint` call in order to determine the visited status of an arbitrary target
URL.

We amplify this attack by using an array of helper link elements to concurrently
scan for visited URLs. Abusing the `registerPaint` function to store state
between paintlet invocations, the attached amplified exploit can probe up to 3k
URLs/sec for visited status. For comparison, the entire Alexa Top 100,000 can be
scanned in 30-40 seconds.

837936,Probing JS bytecode cache allows timing attack,"VULNERABILITY DETAILS

For scripts over a given size threshold, Chromium persists bytecode and other
information generated by V8 to disk, allowing subsequent loads to skip the
most of the initial compilation including parsing. Chromium uses these cache
entries even when a script is loaded from a page of an origin different from
that of the one which originally caused the script to enter the cache. This
allows an attacker to reliably probe the bytecode cache and learn information
about the user's browsing history.

The attacker first selects a script on a target origin that:
* sets a global variable close to the beginning of execution (this is used to
timestamp the ""start"" of the script)
* is large enough such that parsing and starting the (uncached) script takes
a significant amount of time (the attached demonstration uses a 370 KB script
from Yahoo)

The attack consists of two steps:

I. We identify a global variable fitting the criteria above. To this end, we use
a helper page (helper.html) -- loaded in a frame -- to record the initial set of
properties present in the script global (`window`). Then, we load the target
script by injecting a `script` element with a `load` callback. The callback is
used to identify the first new property set on the global object (by comparing
the global keys against the list of keys pre-injection). Our example performs
this step in the user's browser, as part of the attack process; but it could
also be performed by the attacker beforehand.

II. We conduct two measurements to detect whether or not the script's bytecode
was previously cached.

Measurement 1: Using the property name from above we define a setter with that
name on the global. Then, we load the target script by injecting a `script`
element with a `load` callback. The target script is loaded and runs as
usual. However, when it sets that global variable, this triggers our setter,
which records a timestamp (tSet).

When the target script finishes running, our `load` callback is executed. In
this callback, we use the Resource Timing API to retrieve the timestamp at which
the download of the target script's source completed (tDownload).

The time it took to parse and ""boot"" up the target script (independent of
network variability) is: tBoot1 = tDownload - tSet. If the script was not
cached then tBoot1 will be relatively large (e.g., 80ms); at this point, V8 will
produce a serialized dump of compilation information and bytecode which Chromium
will cache. Otherwise, tBoot1 will be relatively small (e.g., 13ms).

Measurement 2: Repeat the measurement process to compute tBoot2. Compare tBoot1
and tBoot2. In the case of a hit, the two will be similarly small. In the case
of a miss, the second measurement will be 2.5x-10x smaller than the first
(e.g., 13ms vs 80ms), as the script load for tBoot2 will have used the entry
created in the on-disk bytecode cache after the collection of tBoot1.

The entire process takes around 100ms total to check a hit or miss for a target
script URL, and can be performed multiple times and in parallel to bulk-query
the cache for a list of targets (e.g. to scan the Alexa Top Sites).

Our attack was originally developed for Chromium 65. The Chromium 66 release
changed the behavior of the cache system such that the in-memory compilation
cache kicked in before the on-disk bytecode cache, masking the performance
difference in the case of a miss. We took advantage of the flaw mentioned at
[https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/v8/src/compilation-cache.cc?l=122-125&rcl=bf02b7365459977012be61c8fd5c9df31f360fd0]
to disable the in-memory compilation cache for the target script before the
attack runs. We insert a load of the target script URL with an additional '?'
appended, which resolves to the same content but is considered a unique URL by
Chromium. As described in the comment, this breaks the in-memory cache for
future loads of scripts with that content, allowing us to carry the attack for
the target script and the on-disk cache as before.

Moreover, SpeechSynthesis::StartSpeakingImmediately and

draw the timestamps used to calculate the elapsed time value from
CurrentTimeInSeconds, which returns a raw OS timestamp that bypasses the
degradation of resolution applied to performance.now() post-Meltdown/Spectre. We
have been able to observe timing precision of 5-7 microseconds via this route
(vs the 20 microseconds exposed via performance.now).

Ideally, Chrome would have one designated API for obtaining a user-safe
timestamp value, instead of applying the necessary filtering ad-hoc at the
performance.now() API boundary.

849677,Persistent quota is not removed correctly,"Chrome Version: 69.0.3450.0

What steps will reproduce the problem?
(1) Request persistent filesystem storage (e.g. at https://demo.agektmr.com/storage/)
(2) Delete cookies and site settings from Clear Browsing Data for all time

What is the expected result?
The persistent storage permission should be revoked either when the storage is removed or when site settings are deleted.
Requesting quota again should show the permission dialog.

What happens instead?
Persistent storage is still granted.

If the chrome account is local, and has never been synced to a Google account, and has locally saved information, especially passwords, it would be sensible to ask them to reauthenticate as the OS user (who owns the local data) before uploading it. This will be a minor and understandable friction to users who are intending to sync since it will only happen the first time per computer. We can even skip it if they have no local data.

882386,Prevent injection of arbitrary bluetooth devices into user sessions,"Currently, Bluetooth pairings are global and ignore any user boundary transitions. This means that a device paired by one user will remain available after logout and another user logging in. For the vast majority of device classes / use cases Chrome OS currently supports, this is reasonable.

With Chrome OS expanding into new form factors, sharing Bluetooth pairings across users sessions can become a risk. For example, consider the case of a detachable with a semi-permanently attached keyboard:

1. User in public space briefly leaves device semi-unattended (e.g. leaving device with acquaintance while going to restroom)
2. Attacker replaces permanently attached Bluetooth keyboard with identical-looking malicious one that contains a keylogger, signs in using guest session to pair it.
3. User comes back, not noticing the swap, logs in using keyboard, thereby revealing their password to keylogger.

We're generally moving in the direction of adding restrictions that prevent external accessories being picked up in user sessions from less trusted contexts. Examples include usbguard (see issue 869063), and detecting and flagging swapping of detachable USB keyboards (see issue 732626).

Sooner or later we'll want to expand this to Bluetooth as well, i.e. either stop paired Bluetooth devices being adopted when starting a user session automatically (might make sense for non-keyboard device classes) or flagging paired devices that the user in question hasn't used before with the device (for keyboards, similar to the USB base swapping functionality).",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I was at her MacBook and I opened Chrome. Chrome was logged in her Google account. I logged her out. Then I logged in with my own Google account. Went to settings and synched my account. Then I realized that the thing I was originally doing didn't work out so I disabled synchronizing and pressed ""Delete bookmarks, history, passwords and other from this device"" and logged out. After that I took my MacBook and opened Chrome in which where I was already logged in. Then I noticed that her bookmarks were in my Chrome so I went to settings. In settings I pressed Passwords and there they were, all her passwords. Passwords were in invisible mode so I pressed the ""eye"" -figure. The system asked MY password and after that I was able to see all her passwords which she had saved in Chrome.

TLS resumption state is shared between non-concurrent and non-overlapping Guest-mode invocations within same normal-mode invocation. This is shown by a second Guest-mode attempting and succeeding TLS resumption from the previous Guest-mode invocation.

This leaks information by allowing anyone able to observe the plaintext TLS handshakes (ISP, network eavesdroppers, destination websites, etc) to correlate that the two sessions are from the same device and potentially the same user.

Closing and reopening Chrome completely clears TLS state.

Incognito-mode is not affected. Incognito-mode invocation do not attempt to resume previous invocation's TLS connections.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Create a Chrome Extension that uses a 3rd-party OAuth Authorization Server
2. Initiate an OAuth flow with chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow

What is the expected behavior?
The new window should:
1. Use the same cookie container as the rest of the browser
2. Show the address bar to allow the user to see the location

What went wrong?
Cookies are not shared between this window and the rest of the browser.

This is a problem for two reasons:
1. Poor UX: If the user is already logged in to the authorization server, they need to login again.
2. Horrible security: The lack of an address bar, combined with the fact that the user will always have to re-enter credentials means that the user has no way to guard against phishing attacks. Tabs should ALWAYS have an address bar, especially in flows which are explicitly used for auth and therefore most likely require entering credentials.

Case#: 17711464

Description:
The same cookie appears as blocked and allowed in the cookie manager. Not sure if this is an intended behavior or not but it looks very confusing to the customer and may raise security/privacy concerns.

Steps to reproduce: 
1. Block third-party cookies in browsers Settings.
2. Go to site that sets third-party cookies (Unify for example)
3. Click on small picture in URL bar that says 'This page was prevented from settings cookies'
4. Click 'show cookies and other site data'
5. Go to 'Blocked' tab, find third-party cookie and click 'Allow' button against entire hostname, not a particular cookie.
6. Reload the page and check Cookies manager again.

Current Behavior / Reproduction: 
Both 'Allowed' and 'Blocked' tabs contain the same cookie.

Expected Behavior: 
The cookie should be either blocked or allowed, not both.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Do a request with the Fetch API to an endpoint that produces a response containing the Clear-Site-Data header.
2. Call header.has('Clear-Site-Data') on the response object.
3. The header.has('Clear-Site-Data') will return false even though the header is present.

Example: https://www.aqualabs.nl/csd-header.html -- It requests an endpoint and prints all headers from the response. In Chrome the Clear-Site-Data header is not included.

Tested in: Chrome 71.0.3578.80 Stable and Chrome 73.0.3635.0 Canary on Windows 10.0.17763.134. Works well on Firefox 63.0.3.

What is the expected behavior?
The Headers-object should return the Clear-Site-Data header when it is present in the response.

What went wrong?
The Clear-Site-Data header is not returned in the Header-object of the Fetch API.

2. If you click in the url bar's lock icon, then cookies on that website will be Visuable.
3. delete all the cookies regarding that website like interviewbit.com
4. save the delete and recheck if the cookies are really deleted or not.
5. Now you can still log in to that website until browser is restarted. 

What is the expected behavior?
After deleting cookie for a browser your log in info should have been deleted from cache too and you should not be able to log in to that website without log in credential.

What went wrong?
I believe when cookies are deleted the cookie info is stored in cache and so user can still log in to that same website without log in credential until browser is restarted.

924047,Migrate some high-entropy HTTP request headers to Client Hints,"A Problem
=========

HTTP request headers expose quite a bit of information about users by default, even over plaintext. It would be better if this information was a) opt-in, b) locked to secure transport, and c) delegated by the first-party to specific third-parties. Client Hints, conviniently enough, provides exactly this infrastructure.

Some Proposals
==============

User-Agent and Accept-Language headers seem like particularly low-hanging fruit:

* https://github.com/mikewest/ua-client-hints suggests that we split User-Agent into UA, UA-Platform, UA-Arch, and UA-Model Client Hints. https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-ua-client-hints

* https://github.com/mikewest/lang-client-hint suggests that we turn Accept-Language into a Lang Client Hint. https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-lang-client-hint has a bit more detail about the implementation.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1

Hey all,

We're seeing a spike in feedback related to browser history not clearing. Specifically, the behavior is that once the deletion process is started, it runs forever with no completion or ability to stop / exit. We haven't tried to reproduce yet, but we're seeing a large enough spike that we wanted to file. Reports are currently only from Windows and OSX.

I think it'd be useful to quote their consumption explicitly.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
Originally reported to Google accounts, but they suggested this is a chromium issue. After reviewing current issues I believe this is an enterprise issue.

Summary: Leaking of saved passwords to Edu accounts / between Edu accounts

Steps to reproduce:
1. Have a Parent Google account with saved password with password sync Disabled
2. Child Edu account with password syncing enabled (enforced by Edu policy?)
3. Allow Edu account to log into laptop while primary account is logged in.

Results in Childs Edu account being able to use and view saved password from Parents google account.

Additionally, passwords will spread between Edu accounts on shared devices (ie School owned Chromebooms)

Browser/OS: 
Chome, all platforms

Attack scenario:
Students at a school can access non-google accounts and google accounts of Parents of students, other students and admin accounts

What is the expected behavior?

What went wrong?
My Son logged into my home laptop and this caused my password and account information to leak to his account. School teachers involved also observed this behaviour and have disabled password syncing and are moving to account per student on shared computers.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
(1) Search for cookies for a specific page like my.favorite.site.com. This will result in a url like chrome://settings/cookies/detail?site=my.favorite.site.com&search=cookies
(2) Do something on my.favorite.site.com (in another tab) which causes one or more cookies to updated for that site.
(3) Reload the chrome:// tab displaying the cookies, and the original (now stale) cookies for my.favorite.site.com are displayed, and the contents of the cookies are displayed herein are not updated, despite the fact that they were updated by another tab.


What is the expected result?

My expectation would be that refreshing the chrome://settings/cookies page displaying site cookies would display up-to-date cookies.


What happens instead?

Cookies from the original (stale) query made by the chrome:// page are displayed, even if the cookies for the site have been updated since the original query

3. Note absence of notification in UI
4. Open ""Files"" app and note absence of memory card from list of available file-systems

8. SD card should mount as normal with a notification

What is the expected behavior?
Chrome OS shouldn't write files to a password protected card, if only out of courtesy.

Chrome OS should raise a UI notification to say why the card can't be mounted

Example URL:

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Download any file from the Web

What is the expected behavior?

What went wrong?
By default (in non-private mode) Chromium saves source information after file downloading a file.
On Linux it is saved to 'user.xdg.origin.url' and 'user.xdg.referer.url' file attributes, on macOS it is saved as 'kMDItemWhereFroms' metadata, on Windows it can be found in the 'Zone.Identifier' stream.

I understand that such a thing is useful to interact with antivirus software and in some other cases.

But saving origin URL and especially referer also can lead to information leak, for example, in case of saving the file from the cloud using a personal link and sharing it with someone by external storage after that: 
another person can access the original version of the file, or, in case of using some specific storages like Nextcloud, can get access to the whole private directory.

So I think that we need an option to disable this feature (e.g. by command line switch) for power users.

Platform: 11895.95.0 (Official Build) stable-channel panther

Steps to reproduce the problem:
Several of the privacy settings under chrome://settings/privacy are currently lacking any explanation.

There is neither some additional sentence below them nor are they even mentioned in the help center article linked via ""Learn more"" above the list:
https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/114836

What is the expected behavior?
As this is a very sensitive topic many users tend to turn stuff off they don't understand. As this often impacts usability there should be some more information provided.

What went wrong?
Lacking some information are:

- Use a web service to help resolve navigation errors
- Automatically send diagnostic and usage data to Google
- Send a ""Do Not Track"" request with your browsing traffic
- Allow sites to check if you have payment methods saved
- Use a prediction service to load pages more quickly
- Enable Verified Access
- Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep

Especially the latter two sound more like a mystery without any explanation ...

For consistency you might also want to split the first option here into a headline and an explanation, too:

Use a prediction service to help complete searches and URLs typed
in the address bar or the app launcher search box

For example:

Autocomplete searches and URLs

987654,Non-top frame can request notification permission,"Chrome Version: (75.0.3770.142 (Official Build) (64-bit))
OS: Linux

According to https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6451284559265792# in M62 the ability to call Notification.requestPermission() from non-main frames was removed. However, I noticed that child iframe can still request to show notification. What is even more strange about it - this is happening not on behalf of the iframe's origin, but of the top-level origin instead.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
(1) Open attached Proof-of-Concept on latest Chrome (not in incognito).
(2) Click on the lock icon on the omnibox to make sure that the notification parameters is equal to 'Ask (default)'.
(3) See a Chrome request dialog '%ORIGIN% wants to: Show notification' pop up. In the case of PoC %ORIGIN% = jsbin.com

What is the expected result?
1) Notification permission requested from an iFrame should be blocked.
2) (Unsure about this one) Notification permission origin should be equal to the frame that is calling it.

What happens instead?
1) Chrome shows a window asking to show notifications.
2) Permissions are wrongly granted to the top-level frame origin and not the one that requested to show notifications.

Chrome outputs a deprecation warning in the console ""notification_generator_base.js:35 [Deprecation] Permission for the Notification API may no longer be requested from a cross-origin iframe. You should consider requesting permission from a top-level frame or opening a new window instead. See https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6451284559265792 for more details."" 
but the notification permission is not blocked.

Despite the fact that the call to Notification.requestPermission() is coming from a child frame at peter.sh, the Chrome request dialog's %ORIGIN% is equal to the top level frame at jsbin.com.

991617,Sandboxed iframe can request to download multiple files without user activation,"Chrome Version: 76.0.3809.100 (Official Build) (64-bit)
OS: Linux

There is a permission issue that allows sandboxed iframe to request multiple file downloads without prior user activation.

Please note that the first file is downloaded automatically - this is a known (soon to be fixed) issue in iframe sandboxing (Issue 539938). This bug is purely for permission and permission delegated issue for automatic downloads.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
(1) Remove jsbin.com and codepen.io from chrome://settings/content/automaticDownloads
(2) Open attached PoC
(3) Observe permission request for multiple file download
(4) Observe that the requesting site is 'output.jsbin.com', even though the download request source is 's.codepen.io'.

What is the expected result?
1) Automatic downloads permission request from a sandboxed iframe is not shown without user activation.
2) (This is permission delegation, but I'm not sure if this is the expected behaviour) Automatic downloads permission request site after user activation needs to be 's.codepen.io'

What happens instead?
1) See attached screenshot (download_request.png).

(This is not directly related to this bug, but is relevant) I'm not sure if permission delegation should apply to automatic downloads. In a scenario where good.com embeds a sandboxed iframe from bad.com and automatic downloads for good.com are enabled, bad.com shouldn't be able to automatically download multiple files on behalf of good.com. 

With attached PoC this is not the case: if automatic downloads for output.jsbin.com are enabled, then any untrusted sandboxed iframe can drop files without a prompt. Permission request window site ('output.jsbin.com' on the screenshot) should be equal to iframe src ('s.codepen.io'). 

Can split that one into a second bug if that way it would be more convenient to discuss.

Im writing because I think I found some kind of security / privacy issue in Chromiums autocomplete.
I figured its possible to make the browser autofill hidden inputs and store those inputs values. That trick could be used in order to get a users email address and/or phone number without them being aware.

I uploaded an example here : https://antoineguillou.fr/form_test.html

Steps to reproduce : Click on the first input and use the browsers autocomplete to fill the form, then click the button. An alert window will display your email address and phone number (if theyre stored in your browsers autocomplete system).

1040098,Clearing history on VideoDecodePerfHistory takes more than 180s to finish on Android,"Chrome Version: 79
OS: Android

According to metrics[1], VideoDecodePerfHistory::ClearHistory is one of the most frequent tasks in browsing data deletion to take more than 180s to finish on Android. 
I assume VideoDecodePerfHistory::ClearHistory doesn't do that much work, so it probably means that the deletion is stuck and will never finish. 

Could you find out if there are cases, e.g. when a database fails to open, that we currently don't handle correctly and that lead to deletions being stuck?
