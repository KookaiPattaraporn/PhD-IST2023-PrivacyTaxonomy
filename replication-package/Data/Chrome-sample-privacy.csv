35316,Click to play plugins,"Chrome Version : 5.0.317.2 (Official Build 38193) dev

i like having some sites set to block plugins (flash) by default
when occasionally i do want to enable the flash content there are exactly 
two options in the new omnibox menu: Continue blocking popups & Always 
allow plugins on [URL]

i am missing an ""Allow this time only"" option. (if it means reload the page 
to do that then reload...)

just like you can still choose to open the blocked popups you should be 
able to temporarily allow the plugins

i guess the same probably goes for blocking images",21,2/11/2010,9/1/2010,202,Feature,2,2

1. In a normal window, log into a site (such as Google).

5. In the Incognito window, select the newly created Google tab.
6. In the Incognito window, open a new tab and go to Google. Notice that only the new tab is not logged in.

What is the expected result?

Any tabs in incognito windows should share the same cookies+state, and should not interact at all with tabs in a non-incognito window.

What happens instead?

You can now get two tabs opened side-by-side in the same incognito window with different cookies. The non-incognito state propagates even to manually entered URLs, so any page loaded in this tab could access cookies from the non-incognito window.

Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if
possible.
As far as I know, there don't seem to be any privacy implications--it seems just as though someone managed to drag a tab from a normal window into an incognito window. The confusing part may be that a user forgot that a certain tab was not incognito, so went to a private site with that tab.

In these cases, the deleted URLs are removed from the system, but the words pulled from them are left in, even if those words are not found in any remaining URLs.

98441,Reporting mis-detected languages exposes https urls over http,"VULNERABILITY DETAILS
The option to report that Chrome has mis-detected the language of a page causes the full url to be transmitted in an unencrypted http query string. When the mis-detected page was accessed over https, the action of reporting mis-detection violates the expectation that https urls visited by the user will not be transmitted over http.

VERSION
Chrome Version: 16.0.891.0 dev
Operating System: OS X 10.6.8

REPRODUCTION CASE
Visit a page over https that is not in a language specified by the user (Preferences > Under the Hood > Languages and Spell-checker Settings) so that the ""This page is in (language) Would you like to translate it?"" bar appears.
With my languages as [English (United States), English], the French Wikipedia landing page works reliably: https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fr/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Accueil_principal

From the Options menu on the bar, select the ""Not in (language)? Report this error"" item.

For the example above, this opens the following url in a new tab: http://translate.google.com/translate_error?client=cr&action=langidc&u=https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fr/wiki/Wikip%25C3%25A9dia:Accueil_principal&sl=fr&hl=en

Note that the specific page I was viewing has now been exposed to the local network. If the mis-detected url had included a security token or session id, that too would have been exposed.

Also note that the url is incorrectly represented on the page as being an ""http"" url with a specified port of 443: ""The web page at http://secure.wikimedia.org:443/wikipedia/fr/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Accueil_principal was detected as French.""

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. With a new install of Chrome or Chromium, disable allowing the setting of site data and 3rd party cookies in 'Under the Hood', 'Content Settings'.

Cookies from the above websites will be stored in Chrome and Chromium's cache, regardless of the browser's settings to not locally store any content. These cookies also retain their original expiration dates so some do not delete themselves for up to 24 years (Amazon).

Note: When you visit a site like https://google.com (secured google.com) a channel id is created during establishment of connection with the server.
If channel id for that particular domain already exists it will not create new channel id else it will create a new channel id.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Go to about settings/clearbrowserdata and clear all browsing data.
2.Go to about:settings/cookies and you will find it empty. Browse https://google.com 
3.Go to/refresh about:settings/cookies and you will see channel id created for google.com and gstatic.com
4.Repeat steps 1, 2, 3

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Clear browsing data used to clear the channel ids too and on Step 4 you will see channel ids getting created. What happens instead is clear browsing data is not deleting channel ids and thus a new connection is not found and you do not see channel ids created in about:settings/cookies.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Use a Chrome dev version with the latest new tab page, which puts the google search box in the middle of the New Tab page.
2. Make sure the following boxes in the Settings menu are turned off: ""Enable Instant for faster searching"" and ""Use a prediction service to help complete searches and URLs typed in the address bar.""
3. Start typing keywords into the omnibox.

What is the expected behavior?
Autocomplete only using previously used keywords and URLs from the local database, without going out over the network to get new words to autocomplete with.

What went wrong?
The omnibox is now autocompleting using Google search results over the network, rather than respecting my settings and searching the local browsing history only.

Did this work before? Yes Yesterday

Chrome version: 25.0.1354.0 Channel: dev
OS Version: Windows 7 x64

I realize that this is a trial run of the new Embedded Search API, as noted on the Chromium blog yesterday:

http://blog.chromium.org/2012/12/faster-simpler-search-in-chrome.html

But this new behavior clearly breaks user expectations for the two Settings listed. If the intent is to back out the new Embedded Search functionality soon after a short trial run, no big deal, but if it's here to stay it needs to respect the settings that disallowed autocomplete using Google services over the internet before.

Also, it's a bit disconcerting that my New Tab page was changed today, even though I did not update the browser. I'm pretty sure the update to 25.0.1354 kept my old New Tab page, only for it to change today without warning or a browser update.",10,12/14/2012,3/1/2013,77,Bug,3,1

BA is a stronger guarantee, because it uses native UI (a native context menu) to show the user the options. But I suspect many users shy away from it because it sounds like Flash will never work if you use this option; really, you can still have Flash just as much as with CTP. We'd like for users to realize that, so I suggest changes to the strings:

381808,JavaScript can detect visited links via CSS nested <a><button> + getClientRects height (OSX),"This template is ONLY for reporting security bugs. Please use a different
template for other types of bug reports.

Please see the following link for instructions on filing security bugs:
http://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/reporting-security-bugs

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
By applying a background color to a CSS selector of ""a:visited button"", javascript can determine whether a given URL has been visited or not by evaluating the containing element's height via getClientRects(), at least on OSX. It looks like the background-color style causes the <button> to change from a native-looking style to a square style. (The effect can be visually observed too, if you remove the ""visibility:hidden"" style on the class "".whoa"").

If History and Bookmark sync is disabled, New Tab most visited sits should not sync.

What went wrong?

421691,Accelerometer/gyroscope leak keystrokes and speech,"VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Accelerometer and gyroscope data is provided to websites without permission prompts, yet can be used to monitor keystrokes, and to a limited extent even speech (as well as being used for fingerprinting).

- Monitoring keystrokes of nearby keyboard (fairly high accuracy) [1]:
http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~traynor/papers/traynor-ccs11.pdf

- Monitoring speech (low accuracy) [2]:

- Fingerprinting:
http://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/2013/10/10/stanford-researchers-discover-alarming-method-for-phone-tracking-fingerprinting-through-sensor-flaws/

VERSION
Chrome Version: all
Operating System: any devices with accelerometers and gyroscopes

POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
- Adding permission prompts for Device Motion/Orientation would be overly heavy-handed.

- Instead we could probably prevent such attacks by limiting either the frequency or the number of bits of precision of data returned by the APIs. We don't want to limit them too much of course, as that might prevent good use cases.

- Alternatively, we could detect when the device is stationary, and limit the frequency/precision only whilst the device is stationary. This wouldn't interfere with most legitimate use cases (except earthquake detection), yet would hopefully make such monitoring impractical due to the noise added by the device being in motion.

(I thought there was already a bug for monitoring key strokes, but I couldn't find one)

426026,Infobar reload removal - Indicates the permission for the last gUM request instead of collectively in use permissions,"Version: 40.0.2185.0
OS: All

Background:
The reload infobar was removed in M40 as its not needed to get the audio and video streams anymore after a device change via the omnibox camera bubble.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
0. Clear media permissions, chrome://settings/contentExceptions#media-stream
1. Browse to favorite gUM page, like http://googlechrome.github.io/webrtc/samples/web/content/manual-test/peer2peer/
2. Request Audio and Video
3. Check camera bubble in the omnibox
4. Request Audio only
5. Check camera bubble in the omnibox

What is the expected output?
Camera bubble should indicate the collectively in use permissions.

What do you see instead?
Permissions from the last getUserMedia request.

Step 3 shows camera and microphone in use.
Step 5 shows the microphone in use only but since the video stream is not stopped it's still active hence the camera icon does not reflect the devices in use.

This is not the case in M39, it does shows the microphone and camera for both step 3 and 5.

This is in my opinion a privacy issue.

Do not get me wrong, I think its a good idea to remove the reload bar, however the camera bubble in the omnibox was not designed to be used without it.

Chrome version: <Copy from: 'about:version'> Channel: stable

Copying from my forum post:

Due to my line of work (international exchanges), I have to use my corporate vpn and I don't want anyone to see our original IP to prevent any scans/attacks etc. However, with the latest chrome updates, it is impossible to block webrtc which reveals the real IP address!

The extension option: there is this webrtcblock extension for chrome but it does not work anymore (see ipleak.net). Some people suggest using that scriptsafe extension but it's terrible. If you use that scriptsafe then it blocks all scripts from all sites and you end up ""allow""ing or ""trust""ing all the sites to see their basic content like catpcha modules - this totally negates what the extension was trying to do in the first place.

OS: All (Win 7: Aero enabled)

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Launch Chrome and go to http://scheib.github.io/HTMLMisc/PointerLockAndFullscreen.html 
2. Click on Toggle Target2 Fullscreen button and click on allow to enter in fullscreen mode.
3. Now set 'Use global default (Ask)' permissions for Fullscreen from page info (by clicking on View site information icon in the omnibox) and again click on Toggle Target2 Fullscreen button, observe the notification bubble.
4. Now go to chrome://settings/contentExceptions#fullscreen, observe the exception.

Actual result:
1. No bubble prompt asking fullscreen permissions is shown and user is directly allowed to go in fullscreen.
2. Exception allowed to enter Fullscreen mode is not cleared from content settings even if Use global default (Ask) permissions is set.

Expected result:
1. Bubble prompt asking for fullscreen should be shown after step 3.
2. Exception allowed to enter Fullscreen mode should be cleared from content settings once Use global default (Ask) permissions is set.

- interface subclass
- interface protocol type

These cookies can later identify users across various different Web services accessed through the browser.

<webview>s however are by design isolated Web instances that do not get access to Chrome’s cookie jar. This means that users need to login twice to access their favorite apps, once to the Chromebook itself and yet another time to their apps (e.g. Citrix).

template for other types of bug reports.

Please see the following link for instructions on filing security bugs:
http://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/reporting-security-bugs


VULNERABILITY DETAILS
I wrote a PoC for reliably sniffing browser history in Chrome/Firefox by observing which domains have associated HSTS entries. I showed it to Chris Palmer, who suggested I file it here :). The code is pretty well-commented but basically it works like this:
1. User visits attacker page
2. Browser attempts to load images from various HSTS domains over HTTP
3. Attacker has set a CSP policy that restricts images to HTTP, so image sources are blocked before they are redirected to HTTPS. This is crucial; if the browser completes a request to the HTTPS site, then it will receive the HSTS pin, and the attack will no longer work when the user visits the page again.
4. When an image gets blocked by CSP, its onerror handler is called. In this case, the onerror handler does some tricks to time how long it took for the image to be redirected from HTTP to HTTPS. If this time is on the order of a millisecond, it was an HSTS redirect (no network request was made), which means the user has visited the image's domain before. If it's on the order of 100 milliseconds, then a network request probably occurred, meaning that the user hasn't visited the image's domain.

This also works in incognito mode (can see which hosts the user has visited in their non-incognito session) and chrome on android. I haven't tried other platforms.

Please note this will be shown as part of a demo of new browser fingerprinting methods at Toorcon next Sunday (10/25).

1. Create a fresh user-data directory, and start Chromium pointing at that directory (using --user-data-dir)
2. Navigate to https://www.eff.org/files/Changelog.txt (and note that this page does not set cookies)
3. Open up the developer tools, and set a cookie via Javascript via the console (say document.cookie=""COOKIE=1; expires=Sat, 31 Dec 2016 12:00:00 UTC"")
4. Navigate to chrome://settings/search#cookie and click on ""Content Settings"", then ""All cookies and site data""
5. Verify the cookie has been set, then close the browser
6. Start Chromium again, again pointing to the same user-data directory (using --user-data-dir)
7. Navigate to chrome://settings/search#cookie and click on ""Content Settings"", then ""All cookies and site data""
8. Verify the cookie for www.eff.org is not listed, even though it hasn't expired and was not a session cookie.
9. In that same tab, open up developer tools, and choose ""Network""
10. In that same tab, navigate to https://www.eff.org/files/Changelog.txt and examine the request headers sent by Chromium
11. The cookie appears to be sent, even though it was not listed in the UI. (If it is not sent, try refreshing the page. There appears to be some sort of non-determinancy where sometimes the cookie is sent, and sometimes it isn't.)
12. Go back to chrome://settings/search#cookie and click on ""Content Settings"", then ""All cookies and site data""
13. Click ""Remove all""
14. If you navigate once again to https://www.eff.org/files/Changelog.txt you will see the cookie is still being sent
15. Close the browser
16. Examine the cookies table contained in the sqlite database user_data_dir/Default/Cookies
17. You will see that the cookie is still in the database, even though we supposedly removed all cookies


ADDITIONAL NOTES
* Not all cookies turn into zombie-cookies, for some reason.
* This is not specific to cookies set via javascript. Cookies set via reply headers also sometimes demonstrate this behavior.
* These zombie-cookies *do* disappear from the Cookies DB and are no longer sent when they expire
* These zombie-cookies *are* successfully deleted by instead using the ""Clear browsing data"" UI path, which makes me think this bug has something to do with Issue 136498

1. Type a specific string in an incognito window frequently (e.g. an acronym in a url)
2. Observe that when typing similar strings outside of Chrome (e.g. in hangouts) the string from the incognito window is suggested as a correction.

Any information typed in incognito mode should not go into the keyboard's dictionary or suggestion model

What went wrong?
The sensitive content typed in incognito windows was suggested outside of incognito window context. This shows that the information is available outside of incognito mode, and opens the potential for a user to accidentally leak something they'd like to be private.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Open a URL with a valid Public-Key-Pins header (I tested with https://cyph.im and https://github.com).

2. Confirm the browser's success of processing the header via chrome://net-internals/#hsts > ""Query domain"".

3. Open chrome://settings/clearBrowserData clear any arbitrary subset of items (e.g. just ""Passwords"", doesn't matter).

4. Re-run the query at chrome://net-internals/#hsts.

What is the expected behavior?
There should be no change from the output of step #2.

What went wrong?
Pinned key hashes (and more broadly, all records prefixed with ""dynamic_"") no longer exist.

May not necessarily be considered a hair-on-fire bug given the user action required to trigger it, but it almost entirely destroys the benefit of HPKP for users like myself who find themselves frequently wiping the browser cache for development/testing/debugging purposes, and it could very easily be leveraged against a user via social engineering as part of a larger targeted attack.

I've confirmed with a colleague to verify that I'm not insane for insisting this to indeed be the case, as we had each (at different points in time last year / early this year) independently expended a memorable amount of effort attempting to figure out how to delete pinned TLS keys after clearing the cache failed to do so, both ultimately landing on chrome://net-internals/#hsts > ""Delete domain"" as the correct solution.

619429,Able to bypass permission prompt on keypress,"VULNERABILITY DETAILS
It is possible for a web page to automatically request and accept webcam access with a single keystroke of Space Bar (without the permission prompt being visible). The webcam recording UI (red dot on tab) is shown as normal.

I believe this is done by simply requesting webcam access in a ""keydown"" event listener. The keypress that activates the request also automatically presses the Accept button (which is focused by default). I haven't looked at the details. Making Deny the default would fix the security problem, but still be a UI issue as it would mean a legitimate attempt to start recording when you tap space bar would fail mysteriously.

625945,Browser history sniffing via HSTS + CSP (bypass previous fix),"VULNERABILITY DETAILS
This vulnerability is about bypassing the fix to CVE-2016-1617 (Issue 544765, see https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=544765). The fix proposed in that bug was to make ""img-src http:"" === ""img-src http: https:"" (See comment 19 in that bug).

But there is a flaw in this fix: ""img-src http://example.com:80"" is not equivalent to ""img-src http://example.com:80 https://example.com:443""; rather, it allows http://example.com/ while blocks https://example.com/. So by simply modifying the CSP header, the trick (using HSTS or 301 redirect) works again.

Note that you must list the domain names explicitly in the CSP (i.e. ""img-src http://*:80"" doesn't block https://example.com:443).

This bug is also reproducible in latest stable version of Firefox.

Maybe it shows http://www.chase.com/ is visited too (this domain has a 301 redirect to https), but in my tests most of the times Chrome doesn't cache the 301 redirect, and I haven't figured out why, but I don't think this affects the exploitability of this vulnerability.",17,7/6/2016,7/8/2016,2,Bug-security,7,1

662382,Incognito bookmarks shouldn't appear on 'recent bookmarks',"Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. In Incognito, browse to a page that you have bookmarked, or open the bookmark specifically
2. Open regular tab and see your browsing history right there

What is the expected behavior?
Recent bookmarks should exclude page visits that occurred in incognito mode.

If possible, it should exclude bookmarks that were created from an incognito window.

Obviously, the fact that a page is bookmarked cannot be discarded upon exiting incognito mode, but ""This page was visited at this time"" seems as close to browsing history as you can get. This gives the user the impression that bookmarking a page exempts it from the promise Chrome makes when you open an incognito window, which is confusing.

What went wrong?
The ""Recent bookmarks"" section in the new tab page shows bookmarked pages that were visited in incognito (and when!).

>>>
I'm hoping someone can double check this for me, but I have been able to replicate the issue on both my Nexus 6 and LG V20 (both running Android 7.0):

Steps to repro:
1) Open an incognito tab in Google Chrome
2) Enable dual-window/multi-window
3) Open a second incognito tab in Google Chrome
4) Move one of the incognito tabs to the other window
5) Optional: sign into an account on any website (such as your gmail account)
6) Close both incognito windows
7) Optional: disable dual-window/multi-window
8) Open another incognito tab and go to your account from step 5 - your previously signed in account will still be signed in.

Observed behavior:
Even after all incognito windows are closed manually, the notification to close incognito tabs remains active and tapping it appears to have no effect. The only way I have found to remove it is to completely restart the phone.

Furthermore, it seems that cookies and other data from the incognito windows remain present until the phone is restarted (or if the issue is fixed any other way).

Users are reporting that after power wash with force enrollment (Esc + Refresh + Power) without switching to dev mode does not actually clear up all user space. 
The only way to clear up the space is to actually do a recovery via a USB or disable force re-enrollment and move the device into dev mode.

We should fix power wash to actually clean up the data being reported as being in use.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Goto chrome://settings/

3. Select ""Choose what to sync""

What is the expected behavior?

709206,Update permission message for location uses message for multiple permissions,"Chrome Version: 59.0.3063.0
OS: Android 7.1.1
Device: Nexus 5X

What steps will reproduce the problem?
(1) Search Google in Chrome Canary. Might need to be a location-sensitive search.

What is the expected result?
The prompt makes sense.

What happens instead?
""Chrome needs permissions access to share them with this site."" (needs-permissions-infobar.png)

1) That sentence has poor grammar.
2) The sentence doesn't communicate that the site already has a permission granted. This is exposed in Page Info (page-info-search-engine-geolocation-disclosure.png), but it's extra confusing for the special case where the default search engine is granted geolocation.
3) It's unclear what permissions are affected. The plural word ""permissions"" implies multiple permissions, even if in this case it's just one.
4) ""Update permissions"" is a blue action button. This is *exactly* the same styling we use for the ""Allow"" button in a permission prompt (mic-prompt.png). Although there is a secondary modal prompt from the OS (os-prompt.png). If I didn't already know a lot about the Android and Chrome permission models, I'd be scared to press that button. (In this case, also consider that Google has a reputation for trying to siphon up all your data.)

Note that this example uses the search engine geolocation case because that's how I triggered it. However, we should make sure to address this if it can ever happen for other permissions.

I think this prompt falls way below Enamel's standards of clarity. Could we try to address it soon?

738209,Allow permission-requiring features in VR if the permission is already granted,"Chrome Version : 61.0.3143.0

Permission-requiring features are currently disabled while in VR (both in the browser and WebVR) because the permission UIs are not yet supported. (Issue 736568 contains references to many of these.)

If the user has already granted permission to an origin and the page has started using the feature, the page can continue to use the feature when inserted into the headset (the VR browser displays an indicator for some features).

However, if the page does not start using the feature, for which the origin has permission, before the user enters VR (including upon navigation within VR), the page is not allowed to use the feature.

Given that we allow the features at all, it's not clear why they aren't always allowed when a permission has already been granted. Such inconsistency seems likely to confuse users even more than the fact that permissions must be granted beforehand.

We should always allow features for which the origin has already been granted permission. While there may be corner cases, such as the user has revoked an Android permission from Chrome, that is an unlikely corner case.",19,6/30/2017,3/14/2018,257,Bug,5,1

Website thumbnail screenshot can be accessed even after deleting all private information such as history, cookies, thumbnails, images and etc (all checkboxes checked and ""from begining of time"" is selected) from Google Chrome webbrowser. Thumbnail can be accessed by visiting ""chrome-search://thumb/http://website_name"" url, which reveals a low resolution screenshot (424x284 pixels) of a visited website. You can see a thumbnail even after Chrome or OS restart. This is a security flaw, because for example someone could visit chrome-search://thumb/http://web.whatsapp.com and see a screenshot of Whatsapp communication with the list of contacts.

What went wrong?
Chrome always inherits CSP to data URL, whether it was navigated by same-origin page or cross-origin page. Thus allowing cross-origin page to gain information of CSP by navigating data URL which contains check of various CSP directives (PoC checks img-src and style-src).

PoC shows that image request was block by parent's CSP but stylesheet was allowed. This data can be used to determine parent's website (by CSP fingerprint) and/or weakness of parent's CSP.

An attacker can determine whether a link is visited or not by observing if
a `paint` method call has been invoked.

In the attached attack, we set a custom painter from a CSS Paint API worklet as
the background of a link element. If we use the DOM to switch the link's href
from a visited URL to an unvisited URL (or vice versa), the `paint` method of
the custom painter is invoked. On the other hand, if we switch it from one
unvisited URL to another unvisited URL (or visited to visited), the `paint`
method is not invoked. We can observe the presence or absence of this extra
`paint` call in order to determine the visited status of an arbitrary target
URL.

We amplify this attack by using an array of helper link elements to concurrently
scan for visited URLs. Abusing the `registerPaint` function to store state
between paintlet invocations, the attached amplified exploit can probe up to 3k
URLs/sec for visited status. For comparison, the entire Alexa Top 100,000 can be
scanned in 30-40 seconds.

837936,Probing JS bytecode cache allows timing attack,"VULNERABILITY DETAILS

For scripts over a given size threshold, Chromium persists bytecode and other
information generated by V8 to disk, allowing subsequent loads to skip the
most of the initial compilation including parsing. Chromium uses these cache
entries even when a script is loaded from a page of an origin different from
that of the one which originally caused the script to enter the cache. This
allows an attacker to reliably probe the bytecode cache and learn information
about the user's browsing history.

The attacker first selects a script on a target origin that:
* sets a global variable close to the beginning of execution (this is used to
timestamp the ""start"" of the script)
* is large enough such that parsing and starting the (uncached) script takes
a significant amount of time (the attached demonstration uses a 370 KB script
from Yahoo)

The attack consists of two steps:

I. We identify a global variable fitting the criteria above. To this end, we use
a helper page (helper.html) -- loaded in a frame -- to record the initial set of
properties present in the script global (`window`). Then, we load the target
script by injecting a `script` element with a `load` callback. The callback is
used to identify the first new property set on the global object (by comparing
the global keys against the list of keys pre-injection). Our example performs
this step in the user's browser, as part of the attack process; but it could
also be performed by the attacker beforehand.

II. We conduct two measurements to detect whether or not the script's bytecode
was previously cached.

Measurement 1: Using the property name from above we define a setter with that
name on the global. Then, we load the target script by injecting a `script`
element with a `load` callback. The target script is loaded and runs as
usual. However, when it sets that global variable, this triggers our setter,
which records a timestamp (tSet).

When the target script finishes running, our `load` callback is executed. In
this callback, we use the Resource Timing API to retrieve the timestamp at which
the download of the target script's source completed (tDownload).

The time it took to parse and ""boot"" up the target script (independent of
network variability) is: tBoot1 = tDownload - tSet. If the script was not
cached then tBoot1 will be relatively large (e.g., 80ms); at this point, V8 will
produce a serialized dump of compilation information and bytecode which Chromium
will cache. Otherwise, tBoot1 will be relatively small (e.g., 13ms).

Measurement 2: Repeat the measurement process to compute tBoot2. Compare tBoot1
and tBoot2. In the case of a hit, the two will be similarly small. In the case
of a miss, the second measurement will be 2.5x-10x smaller than the first
(e.g., 13ms vs 80ms), as the script load for tBoot2 will have used the entry
created in the on-disk bytecode cache after the collection of tBoot1.

The entire process takes around 100ms total to check a hit or miss for a target
script URL, and can be performed multiple times and in parallel to bulk-query
the cache for a list of targets (e.g. to scan the Alexa Top Sites).

Our attack was originally developed for Chromium 65. The Chromium 66 release
changed the behavior of the cache system such that the in-memory compilation
cache kicked in before the on-disk bytecode cache, masking the performance
difference in the case of a miss. We took advantage of the flaw mentioned at
[https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/v8/src/compilation-cache.cc?l=122-125&rcl=bf02b7365459977012be61c8fd5c9df31f360fd0]
to disable the in-memory compilation cache for the target script before the
attack runs. We insert a load of the target script URL with an additional '?'
appended, which resolves to the same content but is considered a unique URL by
Chromium. As described in the comment, this breaks the in-memory cache for
future loads of scripts with that content, allowing us to carry the attack for
the target script and the on-disk cache as before.

seconds since the associated SpeechSynthesisUtterance began playing to the user.
Chrome instead returns the elapsed time in milliseconds.

Moreover, SpeechSynthesis::StartSpeakingImmediately and
SpeechSynthesis::FireEvent (blink/renderer/modules/speech/speech_synthesis.cc)
draw the timestamps used to calculate the elapsed time value from
CurrentTimeInSeconds, which returns a raw OS timestamp that bypasses the
degradation of resolution applied to performance.now() post-Meltdown/Spectre. We
have been able to observe timing precision of 5-7 microseconds via this route
(vs the 20 microseconds exposed via performance.now).

Ideally, Chrome would have one designated API for obtaining a user-safe
timestamp value, instead of applying the necessary filtering ad-hoc at the
performance.now() API boundary.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
(1) Run Chrome with simple cache enabled (e.g. by setting --enable-features=NetworkService)
(2) Visit some website

What is the expected result?
Cache files get deleted from Cache/ directory

What happens instead?
Files get renamed to ""todelete_*"" and only get cleaned up on next start.

There is a TODO to implement a periodic cleanup. Could this TODO be fixed?
Could we perform a cleanup after deletions from Clear Browsing Data to ensure quick and reliable data removal?

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Take password protected microSD card without Android folders (e.g. from a phone not running Android)
2. Put card in Chromebook microSD card socket
3. Note absence of notification in UI
4. Open ""Files"" app and note absence of memory card from list of available file-systems
5. Remove and inspect memory card in another device and note that ""Android"" directory and sub-directories have been created.
6. Remove password from microSD card using other device
7. Replace card in chromebook
8. SD card should mount as normal with a notification

What is the expected behavior?
Chrome OS shouldn't write files to a password protected card, if only out of courtesy.

Chrome OS should raise a UI notification to say why the card can't be mounted

What went wrong?
Folders were created silently on a password protected SD card

There was no UI notification to indicate why a common operation (mounting an SD card) failed for a simple reason (password protected)

Example URL:

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Download any file from the Web

What is the expected behavior?

What went wrong?
By default (in non-private mode) Chromium saves source information after file downloading a file.
On Linux it is saved to 'user.xdg.origin.url' and 'user.xdg.referer.url' file attributes, on macOS it is saved as 'kMDItemWhereFroms' metadata, on Windows it can be found in the 'Zone.Identifier' stream.

I understand that such a thing is useful to interact with antivirus software and in some other cases.

But saving origin URL and especially referer also can lead to information leak, for example, in case of saving the file from the cloud using a personal link and sharing it with someone by external storage after that: 
another person can access the original version of the file, or, in case of using some specific storages like Nextcloud, can get access to the whole private directory.

So I think that we need an option to disable this feature (e.g. by command line switch) for power users.

987654,Non-top frame can request notification permission,"Chrome Version: (75.0.3770.142 (Official Build) (64-bit))
OS: Linux

According to https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6451284559265792# in M62 the ability to call Notification.requestPermission() from non-main frames was removed. However, I noticed that child iframe can still request to show notification. What is even more strange about it - this is happening not on behalf of the iframe's origin, but of the top-level origin instead.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
(1) Open attached Proof-of-Concept on latest Chrome (not in incognito).
(2) Click on the lock icon on the omnibox to make sure that the notification parameters is equal to 'Ask (default)'.
(3) See a Chrome request dialog '%ORIGIN% wants to: Show notification' pop up. In the case of PoC %ORIGIN% = jsbin.com

What is the expected result?
1) Notification permission requested from an iFrame should be blocked.
2) (Unsure about this one) Notification permission origin should be equal to the frame that is calling it.

What happens instead?
1) Chrome shows a window asking to show notifications.
2) Permissions are wrongly granted to the top-level frame origin and not the one that requested to show notifications.

Chrome outputs a deprecation warning in the console ""notification_generator_base.js:35 [Deprecation] Permission for the Notification API may no longer be requested from a cross-origin iframe. You should consider requesting permission from a top-level frame or opening a new window instead. See https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6451284559265792 for more details."" 
but the notification permission is not blocked.

Despite the fact that the call to Notification.requestPermission() is coming from a child frame at peter.sh, the Chrome request dialog's %ORIGIN% is equal to the top level frame at jsbin.com.

991617,Sandboxed iframe can request to download multiple files without user activation,"Chrome Version: 76.0.3809.100 (Official Build) (64-bit)
OS: Linux

There is a permission issue that allows sandboxed iframe to request multiple file downloads without prior user activation.

Please note that the first file is downloaded automatically - this is a known (soon to be fixed) issue in iframe sandboxing (Issue 539938). This bug is purely for permission and permission delegated issue for automatic downloads.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
(1) Remove jsbin.com and codepen.io from chrome://settings/content/automaticDownloads
(2) Open attached PoC
(3) Observe permission request for multiple file download
(4) Observe that the requesting site is 'output.jsbin.com', even though the download request source is 's.codepen.io'.

What is the expected result?
1) Automatic downloads permission request from a sandboxed iframe is not shown without user activation.
2) (This is permission delegation, but I'm not sure if this is the expected behaviour) Automatic downloads permission request site after user activation needs to be 's.codepen.io'

What happens instead?
1) See attached screenshot (download_request.png).

(This is not directly related to this bug, but is relevant) I'm not sure if permission delegation should apply to automatic downloads. In a scenario where good.com embeds a sandboxed iframe from bad.com and automatic downloads for good.com are enabled, bad.com shouldn't be able to automatically download multiple files on behalf of good.com. 

With attached PoC this is not the case: if automatic downloads for output.jsbin.com are enabled, then any untrusted sandboxed iframe can drop files without a prompt. Permission request window site ('output.jsbin.com' on the screenshot) should be equal to iframe src ('s.codepen.io'). 

Can split that one into a second bug if that way it would be more convenient to discuss.
